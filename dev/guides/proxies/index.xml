Prerequisites Integration with Contour requires heimdall being operated in Decision Operation Mode exposing Envoy’s external authorization GRPC protocol.
Being security first ingress controller, Contour enforces TLS for communication between Envoy and any external authorization service. For that reason, heimdall must be configured with an appropriate key material and certificate. Same is actually also true for the http route definition of the actual upstream service.</description></item><item><title>Emissary Ingress Integration</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/proxies/emissary/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Aug 2023 15:23:41 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/proxies/emissary/</guid><description>Emissary-Ingress is an Envoy-powered open source, high performance ingress controller and API Gateway for Kubernetes from Ambassador Labs. Integration happens by letting Emissary-Ingress delegating authentication and authorization to heimdall. If heimdall answers with a 2XX code, the ingress controller will grant access and forwards the original request to the upstream service. Otherwise, the response from heimdall is returned to the client.
Prerequisites Integration with Emissary-Ingress requires heimdall being operated in Decision Operation Mode.</description></item><item><title>Envoy Integration</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/proxies/envoy/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Dec 2022 00:13:59 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/proxies/envoy/</guid><description>Envoy is a high performance distributed proxy designed for single services and applications, as well as a communication bus and “universal data plane” designed for large microservice “service mesh” architectures.
Prerequisites Integration with Envoy proxy requires heimdall being operated in Decision Operation Mode.
Integration Options Envoy makes integration with external authorization services, like heimdall possible via an External Authorization filter in two ways
either via HTTP
or via GRPC</description></item><item><title>HAProxy Integration</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/proxies/haproxy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Aug 2023 07:32:14 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/proxies/haproxy/</guid><description>HAProxy (High Availability Proxy) is a popular open source, fast, and reliable solution providing load balancer and reverse proxy features for TCP- and HTTP-based applications, capable handling heavy load traffic and rerouting requests seamlessly across multiple workloads (e.g. web, application, database).
HAProxy is highly extensible thanks to Lua scripting support. For that reason the vanilla HAProxy does not implement any means of external authorization support and requires custom Lua code to achieve integration with heimdall.</description></item><item><title>NGINX Integration</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/proxies/nginx/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2022 00:14:49 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/proxies/nginx/</guid><description>NGINX is an HTTP and reverse proxy server which became famous as one of the fastest web servers out there, heimdall can be integrated with by making use of the ngx_http_auth_request_module. In such setup, NGINX delegates authentication and authorization to heimdall. If heimdall answers with a 2XX code, NGINX grants access and forwards the original request to the upstream service. If heimdall returns 401 or 403, the access is denied with the corresponding error code.</description></item><item><title>Traefik Proxy Integration</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/proxies/traefik/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jun 2022 18:59:49 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/proxies/traefik/</guid><description>Traefik Proxy is a modern HTTP proxy and load balancer for microservices, heimdall can be integrated with via the ForwardAuth Middleware. If heimdall answers with a 2XX code, traefik grants access and forwards the original request to the upstream service. Otherwise, the response from heimdall is returned to the client.
Prerequisites Integration with Envoy proxy requires heimdall being operated in Decision Operation Mode.
Traefik makes use of X-Forwarded-* HTTP headers to forward the HTTP method, protocol, host, etc.</description></item></channel></rss>
