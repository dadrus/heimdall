Whether you’re building from scratch or migrating existing applications, heimdall can help and allows you to transparently add security capabilities related to authentication and authorization without adding them to your own code, but nevertheless, by completely retaining control.

This is done by routing each request through a rule specific pipeline as depicted in diagram below.\nFigure 2. Request Pipeline This pipeline ensures that, according to the needs of the particular backend service endpoint,\neach request is authenticated (so, you know who the subject of the request is),\nthe required contextual information about the subject is available (like e.g. current location based on IP, roles or groups membership information, etc.), so that\nthe subject can be and is authorized and\nthe information about the subject is transformed into a format, required by the backend service. So that irrespectively of the used authentication or authorization system, the subject information is always provided in the same stable representation.\nAnd all of that can be controlled by each and every backend service individually.\n","description":"","html_content":"\u003cdiv class=\"sect1\"\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"_background\"\u003eBackground\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"sectionbody\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"paragraph\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe diagram below sketches how authentication and authorization is handled in most of today’s applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"_fig_typical_deployment_scenario\" class=\"imageblock\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"content\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"diag-ditaa-md5-6780f491052ccae7422bc1140120bb01.svg\" alt=\"Diagram\" width=\"1210\" height=\"504\"/\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"title\"\u003eFigure 1.

This is done in upstream service specific rules, which assemble the required individual pipelines by making use of different mechanisms.\nFigure 1. Request Pipeline Each rule defines which mechanisms are required for its pipeline and executed in which order.\nIn general each rule contains\nan identifier - to uniquely identify a rule\nan url pattern - to match the incoming request against\na list of allowed HTTP methods for the matched requests\na regular pipeline, consisting of a list with\nauthentication mechanisms, so-called Authenticators, to be executed (if multiple are defined, they are executed as fallbacks) - step 1 in the figure above.\nHere, heimdall typically communicates with the actual authentication systems to get information about the authenticated subject, or to get key material to verify the authentication information provided in the request, or perform other activities related to authentication.\ncontextualization mechanisms, so-called Contextualizers, to be executed (if multiple are defined, they are executed in the order of their definition; can be mixed with authorization mechanisms) - step 2 in the figure above.\nHere, heimdall communicates with other systems as well, either to get further information about the subject, like specific attributes required by the upstream service and not available in the authentication information or the request itself. An example would be information about the request IP, like provided by AbuseIPDB, etc.\nauthorization mechanisms, so-called Authorizers, to be executed (if multiple are defined, they are executed in the order of their definition; can be mixed with contextualization mechanisms) - step 3 in the figure above.\nHere, heimdall performs authorization checks, either locally, or by communicating with yet again further systems, like Open Policy Agent, Ory Keto and alike.\nfinalization mechanisms, so-called Finalizers, to be executed (if multiple are defined, they are executed in the order of their definition) - step 4 in the figure above.\nThis step finalizes the execution of the pipeline and enriches the request with data such as subject information or authentication tokens required by the upstream service. The available options range from adding a simple header over a structured JWT, to driving specific protocols, e.g. to obtain a token required by the upstream service.\nan error pipeline, consisting of error handler mechanisms (if multiple are defined, they are executed as fallbacks), which are executed if any of the regular pipeline mechanisms fail. These mechanisms range from a simple error response to the client (which sent the request), to sophisticated ones supporting complex logic and redirects.\nThe diagram below sketches the related execution logic\nUrl matches rule? - This is the first step executed by heimdall. The information about the scheme, host, path and query is taken either from the URL itself, or if present and allowed, from the X-Forwarded-Proto, X-Forwarded-Host, X-Forwarded-Path, or X-Forwarded-Uri headers of the incoming request. The request is denied if there is no matching rule. Otherwise, the rule specific pipeline is executed. When heimdall is evaluating the rules against the request url it takes the first matching one. That allows simpler matching expressions and supports ordering of rules in rule set with most specific matchig expressions first.\nMethod allowed? - As soon as a rule matching the request is found, a verification is done whether the used HTTP method is allowed or not. The information about the HTTP method is either taken from the request itself or, if present and allowed, from the X-Forwarded-Method header.\nExecute regular pipeline - when the above steps succeed, the regular pipeline mechanisms defined in the matched rule are executed.\nForward request, respectively respond to the API gateway - when the above steps succeed, heimdall, depending on the operating mode, responds with, respectively forwards whatever was defined in the pipeline (usually this is a set of HTTP headers). Otherwise\nExecute error pipeline is executed if any of the mechanisms, defined in the regular pipeline fail. This again results in a response, this time however, based on the definition in the used error handler.\nOperating Modes To support different deployment scenarios, heimdall supports two operating modes:\nas a Reverse Proxy in front of your upstream API or web server, or\nas a Decision Service, integrated with your Reverse Proxy, or API Gateway (like Kong, NGNIX, Envoy, Traefik and much more)\nProxy Mode Figure 2. Proxy Deployment In this mode heimdall forwards requests to the upstream service if these satisfy the conditions defined in matched rules. Otherwise, heimdall returns an error to the client. If the execution of the rule was successful, it also forwards additional headers, specified in the rule to the upstream service.\nStarting heimdall in this mode happens via the serve proxy command. Head over to the description of CLI as well as Configuration options for more details.\nExample 1. Reverse Proxy Example Imagine following request hits heimdall\nGET /my-service/api HTTP/1.1 Host: heimdall:4455 Some payload And there is a rule, which allows anonymous requests and sets a header with subject id set to anonymous like this\nid: rule:my-service:anonymous-api-access match: url: \u0026lt;**\u0026gt;/my-service/api forward_to: host: my-backend-service:8888 methods: - GET execute: - authenticator: anonymous-authn - finalizer: id-header Then the request will be forwarded as follows:\nGET /my-service/api HTTP/1.1 Host: my-backend-service:8888 X-User-ID: anonymous Some payload Decision Mode Figure 3. Decision Deployment In this mode heimdall can be integrated with most probably all modern API gateways and reverse proxies as a so-called \u0026#34;authentication middleware\u0026#34;. Here the reverse proxy, respectively API gateway integrating with heimdall, will forward requests to heimdall by making use of its decision service endpoint for authentication and authorization purposes. As in the Reverse Proxy mode, heimdall will check if these requests match and satisfy the conditions defined in the available rules. If not, heimdall returns an error to its client (here API gateway/reverse proxy). If the rule execution was successful, it also responds to the API gateway/reverse proxy with 200 OK (can be overridden if required) and sets headers/cookies, specified in the matched rule, which are then forwarded to the upstream service.\nStarting heimdall in this mode happens via the serve decision command. Head over to the description of CLI as well as to Configuration options for more details.\nExample 2. Decision Service Example Imagine following request hits heimdall (sent to it by an API gateway)\nGET /my-service/api HTTP/1.1 Host: heimdall:4455 X-Forwarded-Host: my-backend-service Some payload And there is a rule, which allows anonymous requests and sets a header with subject id set to anonymous like this\nid: rule:my-service:anonymous-api-access match: url: http://my-backend-service/my-service/api methods: - GET execute: - authenticator: anonymous-authn - finalizer: id-header Then heimdall will respond with:\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK X-User-ID: anonymous ","description":"Gives you the required insights about heimdall's architecture to get started.","html_content":"\u003cdiv class=\"paragraph\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything you need to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"sect1\"\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"_pipeline\"\u003ePipeline\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"sectionbody\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"paragraph\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs described in the \u003ca href=\"/docs/welcome/\"\u003eWelcome\u003c/a\u003e section and also shown in the diagram below, heimdall authenticates and authorizes incoming HTTP requests, rejecting unauthenticated or unauthorized ones, as well as enriches the valid requests with further contextual information and transforms resulting subject information into a format, required by the upstream services.

For simplicity reasons, we’ll use a configuration file here. So create a config file named config.yaml with the following content:\nlog: level: info (1) serve: decision: trusted_proxies: (2) - 0.0.0.0/0 mechanisms: authenticators: (3) - id: anon type: anonymous - id: reject_requests type: unauthorized finalizers: (4) - id: create_jwt type: jwt default_rule: (5) methods: - GET - POST execute: - authenticator: reject_requests providers: file_system: (6) src: /heimdall/conf/rules.yaml watch: true 1 Here we are setting the log level to info to be able to see any log output. By default, heimdall logs on error log level. 2 Configures heimdall’s decision service to trust requests from all sources. This allows usage of X-Forwarded-* headers. This configuration is only required if you want to try out the docker compose example from below. 3 Configures a couple of authenticators - the anonymous authenticator, which treats every request as anonymous (creates a subject with its id set to anonymous) and the unauthorized authenticator, which rejects every request with 401 Unauthorized HTTP code. 4 Configured a finalizer - the jwt` finalizer, which transforms the information about the subject into a JWT. 5 Configures the default rule, which will obviously reject every request. 6 Configures a file_system provider, which allows heimdall loading rules from the local filesystem; here from the /heimdall/conf/rule.yaml file. With that configuration and without any additional rules, heimdall would reject all requests with 401 Unauthorized. But it has a file_system provider configured, which makes heimdall expect the referenced rules file already on startup. To make it more usable, create a rules.yaml file with the following content:\nversion: \u0026#34;1alpha3\u0026#34; rules: - id: rule1 (1) match: url: http://\u0026lt;**\u0026gt;/public execute: - authenticator: anon - id: rule2 (2) match: url: http://\u0026lt;**\u0026gt;/anonymous execute: - authenticator: anon - finalizer: create_jwt This file contains two rules:\n1 This rule should match the http://\u0026lt;**\u0026gt;/public url and accept every request without performing any authentication and finalization. For that reason it uses the anon authenticator from our mechanisms definitions. 2 This rule should match the http://\u0026lt;**\u0026gt;/anonymous url. It uses the anon authenticator and create_jwt finalizer from our mechanisms definitions. Latter creates a JWT for the created anonymous subject. Run Standalone Run heimdall specifying the configuration file from above\nIf you’re using a binary, put the rules.yaml file into the /heimdall/conf directory (as heimdall will look the rules.yaml file in it according to our configuration from above) just execute\n$ ./heimdall serve decision -c config.yaml The above command will start heimdall in a decision operation mode. By default, the service will be served on port 4456.\nOtherwise, if you’ve built a container image, run heimdall in the decision operation mode via\n$ docker run -t -v $PWD:/heimdall/conf -p 4456:4456 \\ dadrus/heimdall:latest serve decision -c /heimdall/conf/config.yaml In both cases, you’ll see similar output to\n2022-08-04T07:40:12+02:00 INF No opentracing provider configured.

They are expected as we’ve neither configured a rule provider, nor have we configured a key store for JWT signing purposes. Nevertheless, the default rule can be used.\nRun Integrated Alternatively, if you would like to have an environment close to a real scenario, you could make use of docker compose. Create the following docker-compose.yaml file for this purpose:\nversion: \u0026#34;3\u0026#34; services: proxy: image: traefik:2.9.1 ports: - 9090:9090 command: \u0026gt; --providers.docker=true --providers.docker.exposedbydefault=false --entryPoints.http.address=\u0026#34;:9090\u0026#34; --accesslog --api=true --api.insecure=true volumes: - \u0026#34;/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro\u0026#34; labels: - traefik.enable=true - traefik.http.routers.traefik_http.service=api@internal - traefik.http.routers.traefik_http.entrypoints=http - traefik.http.middlewares.heimdall.forwardauth.address=http://heimdall:4456 (1) - traefik.http.middlewares.heimdall.forwardauth.authResponseHeaders=Authorization heimdall: (2) image: dadrus/heimdall:latest volumes: - ./config.yaml:/heimdall/conf/config.yaml:ro - ./rules.yaml:/heimdall/conf/rules.yaml:ro command: -c /heimdall/conf/config.yaml serve decision upstream: (3) image: containous/whoami:latest labels: - traefik.enable=true - traefik.http.services.whoami.loadbalancer.server.port=80 - traefik.http.routers.whoami.rule=PathPrefix(\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;) - traefik.http.routers.whoami.middlewares=heimdall This setup contains three services:\n1 is Traefik, which is used to dispatch the incoming requests and also forward all of them to heimdall first. 2 is heimdall, configured to use the configuration and the rule files from above 3 is a small service, which just echoes back whatever it receives. Use Send some request to heimdall’s decision service endpoint.\nIf you’ve started heimdall as described in Run Standalone, that can be achieved by making a call to heimdall’s decision endpoint:\n$ curl -v 127.0.0.1:4456/foobar If you’ve started heimdall as described in Run Integrated, that can be achieved by making a call to the port 9090 exposed by Traefik:\n$ curl -v 127.0.0.1:9090/foobar In both cases, the default rule will apply, and you’ll receive a 401 Unauthorized response.\nTry sending requests to the /public and the /anonymous endpoints and see what happens. In both cases, the response will be an HTTP 200 OK. And the response from the /anonymous endpoint will also contain an Authorization header containing a JWT, e.g. as shown below.\n* Trying 127.0.0.1:4456... * Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 4456 (#0) \u0026gt; GET /anonymous HTTP/1.1 \u0026gt; Host: 127.0.0.1:4456 \u0026gt; User-Agent: curl/7.74.0 \u0026gt; Accept: */* \u0026gt; * Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse \u0026lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK \u0026lt; Date: Thu, 04 Aug 2022 07:45:16 GMT \u0026lt; Content-Length: 0 \u0026lt; Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJQUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjJkZGIxZDM3MWU1MGFjNDQ5ZGJhNjcyNj ZmZDRjMzU0OWZjNmRmYTYiLCJ0eXAiOiJKV1QifQ.eyJleHAiOjE2NTYxNjY1MTYsImlhdCI6MTY1NjE2NjIxN iwiaXNzIjoiaGVpbWRhbGwiLCJqdGkiOiIxYjdlODdjYi0zYjdjLTQ1ZDAtYWEyZi00MTRhYmI2YjBlMzciLCJ uYmYiOjE2NTYxNjYyMTYsInN1YiI6ImFub255bW91cyJ9.MY6fjk7K6ZNn57Mrjy6UGI1cvIMCOOEJoCQF45PH Q34BfoPxMuTRjdVUZPX4xnT4suyWySsaU1wisgXv4CuMf4WsEUCPKOH8NKv5Zty6eXjTdWQpekDWYsHpVVwz8U HLmrRASlo_JKErj64wPbRcQWyLMR9X-4cR28ZuH3IbyXh4-XlGNEMAVWYFaZGv1QlEd7jcw3jSVK0b5AtY-NUc VQlccWpqWD43AE-3spchqboFuiuW5IxFGd4Mc0Dp6uepuQ-XiWEFg9rxnaxl-Grr3LfSY83oML53Akrl4lGtVB u55QVVjduv_b2ykRnqh7Im9lSivokuVMEuSE8bN2qnqg \u0026lt; * Connection #0 to host 127.0.0.1 left intact You should also be able to see similar output as below from the heimdall’s instance.\n... 2022-08-04T07:45:16+02:00 INF TX started _client_ip=127.0.0.1 _http_host=127.0.0.1:4456 _http_method=GET _http_path=/foobar _http_scheme=http _http_user_agent=curl/7.74.0 _tx_start=1659599116 2022-08-04T07:45:16+02:00 INF TX finished _access_granted=true _body_bytes_sent=0 _client_ip=127.0.0.1 _http_host=127.0.0.1:4456 _http_method=GET _http_path=/foobar _http_scheme=http _http_status_code=200 _http_user_agent=curl/7.74.0 _subject=anonymous _tx_duration_ms=0 _tx_start=1659599116 By the way, this quickstart is also available on GitHub.\n","description":"Describes a very simple use case in which you'll see heimdall's Decision service in action.","html_content":"\u003cdiv class=\"paragraph\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis document describes a very simple use case in which you’ll see heimdall’s Decision service in action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"sect1\"\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"_prerequisites\"\u003ePrerequisites\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"sectionbody\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"ulist\"\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/docs/operations/install/\"\u003eDownload Heimdall\u003c/a\u003e in your flavor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://docs.docker.com/install/\"\u003eDocker\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://podman.io/\"\u003ePodman\u003c/a\u003e, or other container runtime of your choice (examples are however using docker) (optionally) and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/\"\u003edocker-compose\u003c/a\u003e (optionally)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"sect1\"\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"_configure\"\u003eConfigure\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"sectionbody\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"paragraph\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eheimdall can be configured via environment variables, as well as using a configuration file.

For simplicity reasons, we’ll use a configuration file here.\nCreate a config file (config.yaml) with the following content:\nlog: level: info (1) mechanisms: authenticators: - id: anonymous_authenticator (2) type: anonymous authorizers: - id: deny_all_requests (3) type: deny - id: allow_all_requests (4) type: allow finalizers: - id: create_jwt (5) type: jwt default_rule: (6) methods: - GET - POST execute: - authenticator: anonymous_authenticator - authorizer: deny_all_requests providers: file_system: (7) src: /heimdall/conf/rule.yaml watch: true 1 Here we are setting the log level to info to be able to see any log output. By default, heimdall logs on error log level. 2 Configures the anonymous authenticator. 3 Configures the deny authorizer, which rejects all requests. 4 Configures the allow authorizer. It will be used in our rule to allow requests. 5 Configures the jwt finalizer to create JSON Web Tokens. 6 Configures the default rule, which is applied if no other rule matches. 7 Configures the file_system provider, which will load rules from the file system. Put together, this configuration will let heimdall create a JSON Web Token (JWT) with sub claim set to anonymous for every request on every URL for the HTTP methods GET and POST. The JWT itself will be put into the Authorization header as a bearer token. The above default rule does not forward requests, instead it just rejects them with the deny authenticator. To forward requests to the upstream service, we need a configuration of an authorization mechanism in a specific rule, which we’re going to define next.\nCreate a rule file (rule.yaml) with the following contents:\nversion: \u0026#34;1alpha3\u0026#34; rules: - id: rule1 (1) match: url: http://\u0026lt;**\u0026gt;/anonymous forward_to: host: upstream execute: - authorizer: allow_all_requests - finalizer: create_jwt - id: rule2 (2) match: url: http://\u0026lt;**\u0026gt;/public forward_to: host: upstream execute: - authorizer: allow_all_requests 1 This rule matches any hostname and the /anonymous path and forwards the request to our upstream service (which we’re going to define next). In addition, it reuses the configuration from the default rule. Here, the methods, which are allowed, as well as the authenticator. So we don’t need to define them in the rule. 2 This rule matches any host and the /public path and forwards the request as the previous rule to our upstream service. This rule doesn’t perform any kind of request verification or transformation. Create or copy the following docker-compose.yaml file and modify it to include the correct paths to your config.yaml and rule.yaml files:\nversion: \u0026#34;3\u0026#34; services: heimdall: (1) image: dadrus/heimdall:latest volumes: # Mount your config file: - ./config.yaml:/heimdall/conf/config.yaml:ro # Mount your rule file: - ./rule.yaml:/heimdall/conf/rule.yaml:ro ports: - 4455:4455 command: -c /heimdall/conf/config.yaml serve proxy upstream: (2) image: containous/whoami:latest 1 Configures heimdall to use our config and rule files and to run in proxy operation mode. 2 Configures the \u0026#34;upstream\u0026#34; service. Here it is a very simple service, which just echoes back everything it receives. Run Run docker compose:\n$ docker-compose up Docker will automatically download the required container images. Then, heimdall will start in the proxy mode and run with the configuration details set in the previous steps. You’ll then be able to see an output similar to\nCreating network \u0026#34;heimdall_default\u0026#34; with the default driver Starting heimdall_heimdall_1 ... done Starting heimdall_upstream_1 ... done Attaching to heimdall_heimdall_1, heimdall_upstream_1 upstream_1 | Starting up on port 80 heimdall_1 | 2022-08-04T07:50:08+02:00 INF No opentracing provider configured.

Started"],"tags":null,"title":"Proxy Service Quickstart","url":"/docs/getting_started/proxy_service_quickstart/"},{"categories":null,"content":" Configuration in heimdall can refer to two different things:\nthe static startup configuration and\nthe configuration of rules, respectively rule sets\nElements in the static configuration set up the services, like decision service, which basically define the entry points, heimdall will listen to, the observability capabilities, like logging, the supported pipeline mechanisms, the default rule, as well as the rule providers (these elements are not expected to change often).\nThe rule set contains everything that defines how the requests are handled by heimdall for your system. This configuration can change and is seamlessly hot-reloaded, without any request interruption or connection loss.\nStatic Startup Configuration There are two different, not mutually exclusive (you can combine them), ways to define static configuration options in Heimdall:\nin a configuration file (only YAML is supported as format)\nas environment variables\nThe evaluation happens also in the order stated above. That also means, you can always overwrite configuration options defined in a configuration file with corresponding environment variables.\nIf no configuration is provided, heimdall will set useful defaults. These are however not enough, as heimdall doesn’t know your context - which mechanisms are required for the one or the other of your upstream services. So, you’ll not really be able to use heimdall as all requests will be answered with an HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed response code.\nConfiguration File At start up, heimdall searches for static configuration in a file named heimdall.yaml in\n/etc/heimdall\n$HOME/.config\nthe current working directory\nYou can also override this using the config argument: heimdall --config \u0026lt;path-to-your-config-file\u0026gt;.\nThe values in the configuration file can also make use of environment variables. Access to these happens using Bash syntax. Following expressions are supported:\n${var} - Value of $var\n${var=default} - If $var is not set, evaluate expression as default\n${var:=default} - If $var is not set or is empty, evaluate expression as default\nExample 1. Possible minimal fully working configuration The configuration below defines a default rule which lets heimdall create a JSON Web Token (JWT) with sub claim set to anonymous for every request on every URL for the HTTP methods GET and POST. The JWT itself will be put into the Authorization header as a bearer token.\nlog: level: info mechanisms: authenticators: - id: anonymous_authenticator type: anonymous finalizers: - id: create_jwt type: jwt default_rule: methods: - GET - POST execute: - authenticator: anonymous_authenticator - finalizer: create_jwt Example 2. Configuration with a mechanism defined using environment variables substitution mechanisms: authenticators: - id: hydra_authenticator type: oauth2_introspection config: introspection_endpoint: url: http://hydra:4445/oauth2/introspect auth: type: basic_auth config: user: ${INTROSPECT_EP_USER} password: ${INTROSPECT_EP_PASSWORD} finalizers: - id: create_jwt type: jwt Environment Variables Every configuration property, which can be defined in a configuration file can also be defined as environment variable. Following rules apply:\nIf not specified while starting heimdall, all variables start with HEIMDALLCFG_ prefix.\nIf for whatever reason, your environment configuration contains variables starting with HEIMDALLCFG_, which do not define heimdall specific configuration, heimdall will refuse starting if such configuration variable clashes (has an unexpected type) with heimdall’s configuration properties (even for environment variables, the configuration is type safe). You can overcome such situation, by ether renaming such variables, or, if this is not possible, make use of the --env-config-prefix flag with heimdall’s serve command. Properties in a hierarchy are separated by _\nE.g. the log level can be set to info in a config file as also shown in the above example with\nlog: level: info and using an environment variable with\nHEIMDALLCFG_LOG_LEVEL=info Array entries must be defined using _\u0026lt;IDX\u0026gt;[_], with IDX being the index of the array starting with 0 and _ in brackets being only required, if the value of the configured element has a structure/hierarchy.\nE.g. the methods of the default rule can be configured in a config file as\ndefault_rule: methods: - GET - POST and using environment variables with\nHEIMDALLCFG_DEFAULT__RULE_METHODS_0=GET HEIMDALLCFG_DEFAULT__RULE_METHODS_1=POST For structured configuration, like the definition of the authenticators in the example above\nmechanisms: authenticators: - id: anonymous_authenticator type: anonymous The corresponding environment variables would be\nHEIMDALLCFG_MECHANISMS_AUTHENTICATORS_0_ID=anonymous_authenticator HEIMDALLCFG_MECHANISMS_AUTHENTICATORS_0_TYPE=anonymous If a name of a property has _ it must be escaped with an additional _.\nE.g. the service name, appearing for heimdall for your tracing backend can be configured in a configuration file with\ntracing: service_name: foobar and using the environment variables with\nHEIMDALLCFG_TRACING_SERVICE__NAME=foobar Rule Set Configuration Heimdall gets the rule sets from rule providers, which, depending on the provider, can load rules from a plain old configuration file, residing in the local file system, or even integrate with Kubernetes to load rules from custom resources.\nIn all cases, a single rule definition adheres to the schema defined in rule configuration.\nUsage of environment variables in rule sets depend on the used provider.

architectures to suit a variety of deployment patterns. Available installation options are:\nSource code\nBinary\nContainer Image\nHelm Chart\nSource Code You can always build a copy of heimdall by following the following instructions for your OS/environment.\nPrerequisites git\nThe Go programming language \u0026gt;= 1.21\nDownload Retrieve the latest copy of heimdall source code by cloning the git repository\n$ git clone git@github.com:dadrus/heimdall.git Build with go Build using a single line with go build\n$ CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -trimpath -ldflags=\u0026#34;-buildid= -w -s -X github.com/dadrus/heimdall/version.Version==my-custom-build\u0026#34; The flags are set by intention. Using -trimpath and -buildid= as part of the -ldflags argument ensures the build is reproducible (See also Reproducible Builds). Other flags remove unused symbols and debug information.\nBinary Prebuild binaries are available with every released version on GitHub, as well as for every merged PR to the main branch. The version of the latter is set to the git SHA1. Supported operating systems/architectures are:\ndarwin/amd64\ndarwin/arm64\nlinux/amd64\nlinux/arm64\nlinux/armv6\nlinux/armv7\nwindows/amd64\nFor Linux and Darwin the binaries are archived with tar.gz and for Windows with zip. All archives are signed (see also Verifying Heimdall Binaries and Container Images section on how to verify the signatures).\nDownload Retrieve the desired released version of heimdall binary for your operating system/architecture\nARCH=[your arch] OS=[your os] VERSION=[desired version] curl -L https://github.com/dadrus/heimdall/releases/download/${VERSION}/heimdall-${VERSION}-${OS}-${ARCH}.tar.gz \\ | tar -z -x Container Image Heimdall utilizes a minimal container multi-arch image which you can find on DockerHub, or on GHCR. As with Binary releases, heimdall can be pulled in several flavors. These are however currently limited to the Linux OS. Supported architectures are:\namd64\narm64\narm/v7\nAll container images are rootless - so heimdall will always run as a non-root user within the container. Since Heimdall does not have any dependencies, the images are distroless as well and contain only the binary of heimdall and the settings related to the OS user and group permissions, heimdall is running with.\nAs with the binary distribution, all container images are signed (see also Verifying Heimdall Binaries and Container Images section on how to verify the signatures).\nPrerequisites Docker, Podman, or other container runtime of your choice (examples are however using docker).\nPull Image The steps below will pull the images from DockerHub. If you want to pull them from GHCR, specify the ghcr.io registry in front of the repository.\nFollowing tag patterns exist:\nx.y.z[-\u0026lt;prerelease-identifier\u0026gt;] - will pull a specific tagged release.\n$ docker pull dadrus/heimdall:0.11.1-alpha \u0026amp;\u0026amp; docker run dadrus/heimdall:0.11.1-alpha --version heimdall version v0.11.1-alpha latest - will pull the most recent tagged release.\n$ docker pull dadrus/heimdall:latest \u0026amp;\u0026amp; docker run dadrus/heimdall:latest --version heimdall version v0.11.1-alpha Helm Chart Heimdall can be installed via a Helm chart with a few simple steps, depending on if you are deploying for the first time, or upgrading from an existing installation.\nPrerequisites A Kubernetes version \u0026gt;= 1.19 or \u0026gt;= 1.23 if you would like to use HPA\nHelm 3.0+\nAdding the Helm Repository The heimdall Helm Chart is published at https://dadrus.github.io/heimdall/charts. You can add this repo with the following command:\n$ helm repo add dadrus https://dadrus.github.io/heimdall/charts $ helm repo update Installing the Chart This chart expects a heimdall configuration file with authentication, authorization and so on mechanisms, required for your particular setup, which can be passed by using the -f heimdall.yaml flag during the installation.\nIf you need to override the name of the heimdall resources such as the deployment or services, the traditional nameOverride and fullnameOverride properties are supported.\nBy default, heimdall requires custom resource definitions (CRDs) installed in the cluster. The Helm client will install it for you.\nTo install the chart with the release name my-release (my-release is the name that you choose) and configure heimdall to operate in decision mode:\n$ helm install my-release -f heimdall.yaml dadrus/heimdall If you need proxy mode, install it with:\n$ helm install my-release -f heimdall.yaml --set operationMode=proxy dadrus/heimdall For more advanced configuration and details about helm values, please see the helm chart.\nPost-Install Steps Integration with Ingress After having installed heimdall, you have to integrate it with your ingress controller.

If this is not the case, you need to adjust the metadata property by adding the corresponding namespace information, as well as the namespaceSelector.\nIf your Prometheus deployment is not done through the operator, you don’t need to do anything, as the chart already sets the relevant annotations: prometheus.io/scrape, prometheus.io/path and prometheus.io/port.\n","description":"","html_content":"\u003cdiv class=\"paragraph\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeimdall is shipped in multiple formats and architectures to suit a variety of deployment patterns.

Hemdall implements different observability mechanisms to support easier operation and integration in different APM products. The following sections provide insights about what can be expected.\nLogging in Heimdall Heimdall’s implementation uses zerolog - Zero Allocation JSON Logger, which can however also log in plain text. All emitted log statements include information related to distributed tracing (if tracing is enabled) so that not only log statements can be correlated to traces, but also all log statements belonging to single request/transaction can be correlated as well.\nAvailable Logging configuration options are described in Logging Configuration.\nRegular Log Events If you configure heimdall to log in text format, you can expect output similar to the one shown below:\n2022-08-03T12:51:48+02:00 INF Opentelemetry tracing initialized. 2022-08-03T12:51:48+02:00 INF Instantiating in memory cache 2022-08-03T12:51:48+02:00 DBG Creating rule set event queue. 2022-08-03T12:51:48+02:00 INF Loading pipeline definitions 2022-08-03T12:51:48+02:00 DBG Loading definitions for authenticators 2022-08-03T12:51:48+02:00 DBG Loading pipeline definition id=anonymous_authenticator type=anonymous ... 2022-08-03T12:51:52+02:00 DBG Decision endpoint called 2022-08-03T12:51:52+02:00 DBG Executing default rule 2022-08-03T12:51:52+02:00 DBG Authenticating using anonymous authenticator 2022-08-03T12:51:52+02:00 DBG Finalizing using JWT finalizer 2022-08-03T12:51:52+02:00 DBG Generating new JWT 2022-08-03T12:51:52+02:00 DBG Finalizing request Usage of this format is not recommended for production deployments as it requires more computational resources and is hence slow.

These events are always emitted regardless the configured log level and the log level of these events in the log output is always INFO.\nEach request to any of heimdall’s endpoints will result in two access events:\nevent describing the start of the transaction, and an\nevent describing the finalization of the transaction.\nFollowing are the fields, which are always set for both events:\n_tx_start - Timestamp in Unix epoch format, when the transaction started.\n_client_ip - The IP of the client of the request.\nIf the event has been emitted for an HTTP request, following fields are set as well:\n_http_method - The HTTP method used by the client while calling heimdall’s endpoint.\n_http_path - The used HTTP path.\n_http_user_agent - The agent used by the client. The value is taken from the HTTP \u0026#34;User-Agent\u0026#34; header.\n_http_host - The host part of the URI, the client is using while communicating with Heimdall.\n_http_scheme - The scheme part of the URI, the client is using while communicating with Heimdall.\nIf the event has been emitted for a GRPC request, following fields are set:\n_grpc_method - The full GRPC method used.\nIf the request comes from an intermediary, like e.g. an API Gateway and heimdall is configured to trust that \u0026#34;proxy\u0026#34; (see trusted_proxies configuration of the Decision service, as well as the trusted_proxies configuration of the Proxy service), then following fields will be part of the events as well if the corresponding HTTP headers were sent.\n_http_x_forwarded_proto - The value of the \u0026#34;X-Forwarded-Proto\u0026#34; header.\n_http_x_forwarded_host - The value of the \u0026#34;X-Forwarded-Host\u0026#34; header.\n_http_x_forwarded_path - The value of the \u0026#34;X-Forwarded-Path\u0026#34; header.\n_http_x_forwarded_uri - The value of the \u0026#34;X-Forwarded-Uri\u0026#34; header.\n_http_x_forwarded_for - The value of the \u0026#34;X-Forwarded-For\u0026#34; header.\n_http_forwarded - The value of the \u0026#34;Forwarded\u0026#34; header.\nFollowing are the fields, which are set in the transaction finalization event in addition:\n_body_bytes_sent - The length of the response body.\n_tx_duration_ms - The duration of the transaction in milliseconds. If heimdall is operated in proxy mode, it will also include the time used to communicate with the upstream service.\n_access_granted - Set either to true or false, indicating whether heimdall granted access or not.\n_subject - The subject identifier if the access was granted.\n_error - The information about an error, which e.g. led to the denial of the request.\nIf the finalization event has been emitted for an HTTP request, following fields are set as well:\n_http_status_code - The numeric HTTP response status code\nIf the finalization event has been emitted for a GRPC request, following fields are set:\n_grpc_status_code - The numeric GRPC status code.\nFollowing are the fields, which are set if tracing is enabled:\n_trace_id - The trace id as defined by OpenTelemetry.\n_span_id - The span id as defined by OpenTelemetry of the current transaction.\n_parent_id - The span id of the callee, which started the given transaction. Only present if the callee set the corresponding tracing header.\nIf you configure heimdall to log in text format, you can expect output as shown below:\n2022-08-03T12:40:16+02:00 INF TX started _client_ip=127.0.0.1 _http_host=127.0.0.1:4468 _http_method=GET _http_path=/foo _http_scheme=http _http_user_agent=curl/7.74.0 _parent_id=3449bda63ed70206 _span_id=f57c007257fee0ed _trace_id=00000000000000000a5af97bffe6a8a2 _tx_start=1659523216 .... 2022-08-03T12:40:16+02:00 INF TX finished _access_granted=true _body_bytes_sent=0 _client_ip=127.0.0.1 _http_host=127.0.0.1:4468 _http_method=GET _http_path=/foo _http_scheme=http _http_status_code=202 _http_user_agent=curl/7.74.0 _subject=anonymous _parent_id=3449bda63ed70206 _span_id=f57c007257fee0ed _trace_id=00000000000000000a5af97bffe6a8a2 _tx_duration_ms=0 _tx_start=1659523216 Otherwise, if you configure it to use gelf format, the output will look as follows:\n{\u0026#34;_level_name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;INFO\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;1.1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;host\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;unknown\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;_tx_start\u0026#34;:1659523295, \u0026#34;_client_ip\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;127.0.0.1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;_http_method\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;GET\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;_http_path\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;/foo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;_http_user_agent\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;curl/7.74.0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;_http_host\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;127.0.0.1:4468\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;_http_scheme\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;http\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;timestamp\u0026#34;: 1659523295, \u0026#34;level\u0026#34;: 6, \u0026#34;_parent_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;3449bda63ed70206\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;_span_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;f57c007257fee0ed\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;_trace_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;00000000000000000a5af97bffe6a8a2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;short_message\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;TX started\u0026#34;} .... {\u0026#34;_level_name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;INFO\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1.1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;host\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;unknown\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;_tx_start\u0026#34;: 1659523295, \u0026#34;_client_ip\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;127.0.0.1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;_http_method\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;GET\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;_http_path\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/foo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;_http_user_agent\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;curl/7.74.0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;_http_host\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;127.0.0.1:4468\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;_http_scheme\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;http\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;_body_bytes_sent\u0026#34;: 0, \u0026#34;_http_status_code\u0026#34;:200, \u0026#34;_tx_duration_ms\u0026#34;:0, \u0026#34;_subject\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;anonymous\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;_access_granted\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;timestamp\u0026#34;:1659523295, \u0026#34;level\u0026#34;: 6, \u0026#34;_parent_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;3449bda63ed70206\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;_span_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;f57c007257fee0ed\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;_trace_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;00000000000000000a5af97bffe6a8a2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;short_message\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;TX finished\u0026#34;} Tracing in Heimdall Heimdall makes use of OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing to support recording of paths taken by requests and supports all environment variables including the defined values according to OpenTelemetry Environment Variables and OpenTelemetry SDK Configuration specifications. In addition to these environment variables, heimdall defines some additional options, which are described in Tracing Configuration and can be used to tune the behaviour.\nTracing is enabled by default. On one hand, this chapter serves the purpose of a quick introduction to distributed tracing with heimdall and on the other hand to list the options that go beyond the standard OTEL definitions.\nTracing Context Propagation When a request arrives at heimdall, it will create a trace context object based on the received headers, which according to OTEL are the traceparent and tracestate HTTP headers, defined in W3C Trace Context as well as baggage HTTP header, defined in W3C Baggage. The creation of that context, as well as the transformation of it into new HTTP headers, set by heimdall while communicating with further services is named propagation and the components responsible for the creation of such context object are named propagators.\nSince not every service in a multi-service system may set or understand the above OTEL specific HTTP headers (as these might still be using tracing vendor specific headers), interoperability can be achieved by configuring the required propagators by making use of the OTEL_PROPAGATORS environment variable. OTEL defines the following values for this variable:\ntracecontext - W3C Trace Context propagator. Enabled by default, if OTEL_PROPAGATORS is not set.\nbaggage - W3C Baggage propagator. Enabled by default if OTEL_PROPAGATORS is not set.\nb3 - Zipkin B3 Single Header propagator.\nb3multi - Zipkin B3 Multiple Header propagator.\njaeger - Jaeger Header propagator.\nxray - AWS X-Ray Header propagator.\nottrace - OT Trace Header propagator.\nnone - No automatically configured propagator.\nAll of these are supported by heimdall. In addition, following propagators can be configured as well:\ndatadog - Datadog APM Trace Header propagator.[1]\nConfigured propagators are used for inbound, as well as for outbound traffic.\nSpan Exporters Span Exporter handle the delivery of spans to external receivers (collectors, or agents). This is the final component in the trace export pipeline and typically provided by the APM vendor, like Jaeger, Zipkin, Instana, etc. Since not every multi-service system may have an up to day telemetry receiver supporting protocols defined by OTEL, interoperability can be achieved by configuring the required exporters by making use of the OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER environment variable. OTEL defines the following values for this variable[2]:\notlp - OTLP exporter. Enabled by default if OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER is not set.\nzipkin - Zipkin exporter to export spans in Zipkin data model.\nnone - No automatically configured exporter for traces.\nAll of these are supported by heimdall. In addition, following exporters can be configured as well:\ninstana - Instana exporter to export spans in Instana data model.[3]\nExample Configuration The environment variables set below configure heimdall to use Jaeger propagator and to export the spans via OTLP over grpc to the collector available under http://collector:4317.\nOTEL_PROPAGATORS=jaeger OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=otlp OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_PROTOCOL=grpc OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT=http://collector:4317 If your environment supports OpenTelemetry and usage of defaults is ok, most probably, the only required environment variable to be set might be the OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT.\nMetrics in Heimdall Heimdall makes use of OpenTelemetry to emit metrics. Depending on the configuration, push or pull based metrics export is supported. As with tracing, the entire configuration happens via environment variables as defined by OpenTelemetry Environment Variables and OpenTelemetry SDK Configuration specifications. In addition to these environment variables, heimdall allows disabling collection and exposure of metrics if required, which is described under Tracing Configuration.\nMetric exposure is enabled by default. This chapter serves the purpose of a quick introduction to metrics collected and exposed by heimdall.\nMetric Exporters By default, metrics are pushed to the OTEL collector using the http/protobuf transport protocol. You can change that behavior by making use of either the OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_PROTOCOL, or the OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL environment variable.\nTo let heimdall know where to push the metrics to, either OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_ENDPOINT, or OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT must be defined.\nTo let heimdall expose metrics over a pull based service (Prometheus style), the OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER environment variable must be set to \u0026#34;prometheus\u0026#34;. In that case heimdall will expose the 127.0.0.1:9464/metrics endpoint which can be queried using the HTTP GET verb. You can change the host and port of that service by making use of the OTEL_EXPORTER_PROMETHEUS_HOST and OTEL_EXPORTER_PROMETHEUS_PORT environment variables.\nAvailable Metrics System metrics according to OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions for System Metrics.\nProcess and Go runtime metrics according to OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions for OS Process Metrics.\nInformation about the handled requests on each active service, as well as information about requests in progress according to OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions for HTTP Metrics and General RPC conventions.\nInformation about the metrics endpoint itself (if enabled), including the number of internal errors encountered while gathering the metrics, number of current inflight and overall scrapes done.\nInformation about expiry for configured certificates.\nAll, but custom metrics adhere to the OpenTelementry semantic conventions. For that reason, only the custom metrics are listed in the table below.\nMetric: certificate.expiry Number of seconds until a certificate used by a particular service (decision, proxy, management), as well as signer expires. The metric type is UpDownCounter und the unit is s.\nAttribute Type Description service\nstring\nThe service, the certificate is configured for.\nissuer\nstring\nIssuer DN of the certificate.\nserial_nr\nstring\nThe serial number of the certificate.\nsubject\nstring\nSubject DN of the certificate.\ndns_names\nstring\nDNS entries in the SAN extension\nRuntime Profiling in Heimdall If enabled, heimdall exposes a /debug/pprof HTTP endpoint on port 10251 (See also Runtime Profiling Configuration) on which runtime profiling data in the profile.proto format (also known as pprof format) can be consumed by APM tools, like Google’s pprof, Grafana Phlare, Pyroscope and many more for visualization purposes. Following information is available:\nallocs - A sampling of all past memory allocations.\nblock - Stack traces that led to blocking on synchronization primitives.\ncmdline - The command line invocation of the current program, with arguments separated by NUL bytes.\ngoroutine - Stack traces of all current goroutines.\nheap - A sampling of memory allocations of live objects.\nmutex - Stack traces of holders of contended mutexes.\nprofile - Cpu profile. Profiling lasts for duration specified in seconds parameter, or for 30 seconds if not specified\nsymbol - Looks up the program counters listed in the request, responding with a table mapping program counters to function names.\nthreadcreate - Stack traces that led to the creation of new OS threads.\ntrace - Execution trace in binary form. Tracing lasts for duration specified in seconds parameter, or for 1 second if not specified.\nSee also the API documentation for the documentation of the actual API.\n1. Datadog supports the OTLP protokoll. For that reason, there is no exporter available. 2. jaeger exporter has been marked as deprecated and is not supported anymore 3. Instana supports the W3C header used by OTEL. For that reason, there is no propagator available.

Following sections address the corresponding areas.\nHTTP Header Security Considerations If trusted_proxies property is configured (see also the corresponding Decision and Proxy service configuration options) to let heimdall make use of different HTTP headers to build the URL for rule and HTTP method matching purposes, following logic apply:\nThe value for the used HTTP scheme is taken from the X-Forwarded-Proto header.\nThe value for the used HTTP host and port is taken from the X-Forwarded-Host header.\nThe value for the used HTTP path is taken either from X-Forwarded-Uri or X-Forwarded-Path with X-Forwarded-Uri taking precedence. Compared to X-Forwarded-Path, X-Forwarded-Uri does also contain query parameters.\nThe value for the used HTTP method is taken from the X-Forwarded-Method header.\nIf the evaluation result for any of the above said steps is empty, the corresponding value is taken from the actual request to heimdall. E.g. if X-Forwarded-Method is set, the HTTP method used to communicate with heimdall is used for rule matching respectively evaluation purposes.\nThat means, if the client integrating with heimdall does not make use of the above said headers and does not drop them, a malicious actor could spoof them most probably leading to privileges escalation (depending on your rules). To avoid such situations, please adhere to the following practices:\nIf you can, try avoiding usage of trusted_proxies. Nothing can be spoofed then. However, you will lose the information about the used HTTP scheme, host and port and cannot rely on these in your rules.\nConfigure all headers and use those taking precedence. That is, always set X-Forwarded-Method, X-Forwarded-Proto, X-Forwarded-Host, X-Forwarded-Uri.\nIf you cannot influence, which headers are set by your system, you’re integrating with heimdall, let it drop unused ones. E.g. If the proxy forwarding the request to heimdall by default sets only X-Forwarded-Proto and X-Forwarded-Host, let it drop the X-Forwarded-Method and X-Forwarded-Uri headers.\nThe Integration Guides follow these practices, respectively highlight where caution is required. So, you can find examples there.\nObservability Information Logs, metrics and profiling information is very valuable for operating heimdall. These are however also very valuable for any adversary. For this reason, the corresponding services, which expose such information are by default, if enabled, listening only on the loopback (127.0.0.1) interface. If you have to configure them to listen to other interfaces, e.g. because you operate heimdall in a container, make sure, you don’t expose them publicly.\nTLS As documented in Concepts section, the execution of heimdall’s pipeline typically includes communication to other systems. The endpoints of the corresponding systems should be TLS protected. This is however actually out of scope for heimdall. What is in scope, is the verification of the used TLS server certificate, if TLS is used. This happens by making use of the operating system-wide trust store, containing the certificates of Root and Intermediate CAs (trust anchors) shipped with the OS. That means, you should\nensure this trust store contains the certificates of the Root CAs of your PKI hierarchy and\nensure the endpoints, heimdall communicates with over TLS, provide not only their own certificates, but also the intermediate certificates and cross certificates not included within the OS trust store\nBoth is required to enable heimdall building the certificate chain for TLS server certificate verification purpose. If heimdall fails doing so, the connection will be dropped.\nAs written above, heimdall makes use of the OS wide trust store to build the certificate chain. The most common installation directory on a Linux system for that trust store is the /etc/ssl/certs directory. In addition to the separate root and intermediate CA certificates, it also contains a ca-certificates.crt file, containing all installed certificates as well. This file is used by heimdall for the aforesaid purpose.\nheimdall container image is shipped without any certificates by intention to ensure you take care about the up-to-date status of the trust store. This way, if you use heimdall in a container, you have to mount the OS trust store into heimdall’s container to enable its usage.\nE.g.\ndocker run -t -p 4456:4456 \\ -v $PWD:/heimdall/conf \\ -v /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt:/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt:ro \\ dadrus/heimdall:latest serve decision \\ -c /heimdall/conf/heimdall.yaml The verification of TLS server certificates is not the single configuration option. You should also ensure heimdall’s services, you’re using, are configured to be available via TLS as well. See TLS Configuration for all available options.\nSignatures When heimdall is used to issue signed objects, like JWTs, to enable upstream services to rely on authentic subject information, it acts as an issuer of such objects and requires corresponding configuration (see Cryptographic Material).\nIn a typical production scenario, there is a need for proper key and certificate management. This is supported by heimdall in the following way:\nyou can and should configure not only the private key for signature creation purposes, but also the corresponding certificate chain. This way your upstream services are able not only to verify the signatures of the signed objects for cryptographic validity, but also perform verification of the revocation status of used certificates and also their time validity. All of that is crucial for secure communication.\nThe cryptographic material for the above said verification purposes is available via the JWKS endpoint for the upstream services.\nyou can configure multiple keys in heimdall’s key_store and specify the key_id of the key to use. The easiest way to let heimdall use the key id, you need, is to set X-Key-ID header in the PEM block of the corresponding private key. With that in place you can perform key roll over without down-times by first updating the key stores of all heimdall instances to include the new key and certificates, and when this is done, by updating the key id to reference the new key material instance by instance. This way all upstream services can verify the signatures of the objects issued by heimdall, regardless of the used key material, as all heimdall instances, are able to serve the new and the old cryptographic material.\nVerifying Heimdall Binaries and Container Images Heimdall binaries and container images are signed using Cosign and the keyless signing feature.\nPrerequisites Install Cosign\nContainer Image Signature Verification The signatures are stored in a repository named dadrus/heimdall-signatures.

This way all upstream services can verify the signatures of the objects issued by heimdall, regardless of the used key material, as all heimdall instances, are able to serve the new and the old cryptographic material.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"sect1\"\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"_verifying_heimdall_binaries_and_container_images\"\u003eVerifying Heimdall Binaries and Container Images\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"sectionbody\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"paragraph\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeimdall binaries and container images are signed using \u003ca href=\"https://docs.sigstore.dev/docs/signing/quickstart/\"\u003eCosign\u003c/a\u003e and the \u003ca href=\"https://docs.sigstore.dev/docs/signing/overview/\"\u003ekeyless signing feature\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"sect2\"\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"_prerequisites\"\u003ePrerequisites\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"ulist\"\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstall \u003ca href=\"https://docs.sigstore.dev/docs/system_config/installation/\"\u003eCosign\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"sect2\"\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"_container_image_signature_verification\"\u003eContainer Image Signature Verification\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"paragraph\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe signatures are stored in a repository named \u003ccode\u003edadrus/heimdall-signatures\u003c/code\u003e.

That way, as also described in the Envoy Integration Guide, Envoy will delegate authentication and authorization to heimdall.

Otherwise, the response from heimdall is treated as an error and is returned to the client.\nBeing security first ingress controller, Contour enforces TLS for communication between Envoy and any external authorization service. For that reason, heimdall must be configured with an appropriate key material and certificate.

However, it looks like Contour does not configure Envoy to support TLS v1.3 so that the communication with heimdall happens via TLS v1.2 and below. For that reason you have to configure the decision service of heimdall to TLS v1.2 being the minimum supported version. Otherwise, Envoy will not be able communicating with heimdall, resulting in 403 responses for any request. The following snippet shows the relevant parts in the heimdall configuration file:\n# ... serve: decision: tls: # important! see explanations above min_version: TLS1.2 key_store: # path to the pem file with key and certificates path: /certs/tls-combined.pem # ...

When operating heimdall in Decision Operation Mode, integration with Envoy can be achieved by making use of an External Authorization filter. In such setup, Envoy delegates authentication and authorization to heimdall. If heimdall answers with a 200 OK HTTP code, Envoy grants access and forwards the original request to the upstream service. Otherwise, the response from heimdall is treated as an error and is returned to the client.\nTo achieve this, configure Envoy\nto have heimdall instances referenced in a cluster\nFollowing snippet provides an example on how to create a cluster instance referencing heimdall. It assumes, you have just one heimdall instance deployed, which is also available via heimdall DNS name.\nclusters: # other cluster entries - name: ext-authz type: strict_dns load_assignment: cluster_name: ext-authz endpoints: - lb_endpoints: - endpoint: address: socket_address: address: heimdall port_value: 4456 # other cluster entries If you want to integrate via Envoy’s grpc_service (see below), the cluster entry from above must have http2_protocol_options configured, as otherwise envoy will use HTTP 1 for GRPC communication, which is actually not allowed by GRPC (only HTTP 2 is supported). Here is an updated snipped:\nclusters: # other cluster entries - name: ext-authz type: strict_dns typed_extension_protocol_options: envoy.extensions.upstreams.http.v3.HttpProtocolOptions: \u0026#34;@type\u0026#34;: type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.upstreams.http.v3.HttpProtocolOptions explicit_http_config: http2_protocol_options: {} load_assignment: cluster_name: ext-authz endpoints: - lb_endpoints: - endpoint: address: socket_address: address: heimdall port_value: 4456 # other cluster entries to include an External Authorization HTTP filter in the definition of the HTTP connection manager and depending on the used configuration, either configure the http_service and let it contain the required header name(s), heimdall sets in the HTTP responses (depends on your Contextualizers and Finalizers configuration), or configure the grpc_service.\nThe following snipped shows, how an External Authorization can be defined using http_service to let Envoy communicating with heimdall by making use of the previously defined cluster (see snippet from above) as well as forwarding all request headers to heimdall and to let it forward headers, set by heimdall in its responses (here the Authorization header) to the upstream services.\nhttp_filters: # other http filter - name: envoy.filters.http.ext_authz typed_config: \u0026#34;@type\u0026#34;: type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.filters.http.ext_authz.v3.ExtAuthz transport_api_version: V3 http_service: server_uri: uri: heimdall:4456 cluster: ext-authz timeout: 0.25s authorization_request: allowed_headers: patterns: - safe_regex: google_re2: {} regex: \u0026#34;.*\u0026#34; authorization_response: allowed_upstream_headers: patterns: - exact: authorization # other http filter The following snipped shows, how an External Authorization can be defined using grpc_service to let Envoy communicating with heimdall by making use of the previously defined cluster (see snippet from above). In that configuration envoy by default forwards all request header to heimdall and also forwards headers, set by heimdall in its responses to the upstream services.\nhttp_filters: # other http filter - name: envoy.filters.http.ext_authz typed_config: \u0026#34;@type\u0026#34;: type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.filters.http.ext_authz.v3.ExtAuthz transport_api_version: V3 grpc_service: envoy_grpc: cluster_name: ext-authz # other http filter Envoy does not set X-Forwarded-* headers, as long as the envoy.filters.http.dynamic_forward_proxy is not configured. In such cases matching of URLs happens based on those URLs, used by Envoy while communicating with heimdall. That means your rules should ignore the scheme and host parts, respectively use the values specific for heimdall and not of the domain. Please follow Security Considerations if your rules rely on any of the X-Forwarded-* headers, and you integrate heimdall with envoy using http_service.\nIf you integrate heimdall with envoy via grpc_service, spoofing of the aforesaid headers is not possible.\nDemo Setup The Envoy configuration file shown below can be used to create a fully working setup based on the Decision Service Quickstart. Just update the docker-compose.yaml file used in that guide and replace the entry for proxy service, with the one shown below. You can also remove all labels configurations, as these will have no effect.\n# docker-compose.yaml services: proxy: image: envoyproxy/envoy:v1.24.1 volumes: - ./envoy.yaml:/envoy.yaml:ro ports: - 9090:9090 command: -c /envoy.yaml # other services from the guide # envoy.yaml static_resources: listeners: - name: listener_0 address: socket_address: address: 0.0.0.0 port_value: 9090 filter_chains: - filters: - name: envoy.filters.network.http_connection_manager typed_config: \u0026#34;@type\u0026#34;: type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager stat_prefix: edge http_filters: - name: envoy.filters.http.ext_authz typed_config: \u0026#34;@type\u0026#34;: type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.filters.http.ext_authz.v3.ExtAuthz transport_api_version: V3 http_service: server_uri: uri: heimdall:4456 cluster: ext-authz timeout: 0.25s authorization_request: allowed_headers: patterns: - safe_regex: google_re2: {} regex: \u0026#34;.*\u0026#34; authorization_response: allowed_upstream_headers: patterns: - exact: authorization - name: envoy.filters.http.router typed_config: \u0026#34;@type\u0026#34;: type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.filters.http.router.v3.Router route_config: virtual_hosts: - name: direct_response_service domains: [\u0026#34;*\u0026#34;] routes: - match: prefix: \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; route: cluster: services clusters: - name: ext-authz type: strict_dns load_assignment: cluster_name: ext-authz endpoints: - lb_endpoints: - endpoint: address: socket_address: address: heimdall port_value: 4456 - name: services connect_timeout: 5s type: strict_dns dns_lookup_family: V4_ONLY load_assignment: cluster_name: services endpoints: - lb_endpoints: - endpoint: address: socket_address: address: upstream port_value: 80 After starting the docker compose environment, you can run the curl commands shown in the referenced guide. This time however against envoy by using port 9090. E.g. $ curl -v 127.0.0.1:9090/anonymous. By the way, this setup is also available on GitHub.\n","description":"Explains how to integrate heimdall with Envoy, a high performance distributed proxy.","html_content":"\u003cdiv class=\"paragraph\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.envoyproxy.io/\"\u003eEnvoy\u003c/a\u003e is a high performance distributed proxy designed for single services and applications, as well as a communication bus and “universal data plane” designed for large microservice “service mesh” architectures.

As such it is a very good fit for integrating with heimdall. And indeed, the integration is very simple. It is just a matter of using a Remote Authorizer or a Generic Contextualizer. Which one is better for a particular use case depends on the specific application requirements. Here some examples demonstrating these and how it can be solved with heimdall:\nExample 1. Sharing Service Imagine you have a sharing service, e.g. to let friends share all their photos with each other and the API looks roughly as follows:\nGET /\u0026lt;user\u0026gt;/photos returns all the photos of the user either to the owner of the photo collection itself or to its friends.\nTo achieve this using OPA, we would need something like the following Rego policy:\npackage share_photos default allow = false # user is owner. that is, the value of first path # fragment is equal to the identified user allow { split(input.path, \u0026#34;/\u0026#34;)[1] == input.user } # user is friend. that is, the user referenced by the # first path fragment has the identified user in its friends list allow { data.friends[split(input.path, \u0026#34;/\u0026#34;)[1]][_] == input.user } It expects two pieces of information in the payload to the OPA instance:\nthe actual user, making the request and\nthe path to witch the request is made\nSo something like this: { \u0026#34;input\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;user\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;alice\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;path\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;bob/photos\u0026#34; } }. Since the Rego policy defined above returns just true or false, the corresponding response from the OPA endpoint would be { \u0026#34;result\u0026#34;: true } or { \u0026#34;result\u0026#34;: false }. Given this and assuming the above policy can be used by making requests to https://opa.local/v1/data/share_photos/policy/allow, the configuration of the Remote Authorizer would look like follows:\nid: photos_access type: remote config: endpoint: url: https://opa.local/v1/data/share_photos/policy/allow payload: | { \u0026#34;input\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;user\u0026#34;: {{ quote .Subject.ID }}, \u0026#34;path\u0026#34;: {{ quote .RequestURL.Path }} } } expressions: - expression: | Payload.result == true Here the entire authorization happens within heimdall and is completely outsourced from the business logic of our sharing service.\nExample 2. Membership Verification Imagine you have a billing service, which requires information about the membership of a user to different groups, which represent different subscription options for you entire offering. Depending on this information your service would create invoices with different amounts. The imaginary API of that service could look like follows:\nPOST /create_invoice to invoice the identified user.\nYou could perform the required query to OPA entirely in your service and use the retrieved group memberships then. Alternatively, you could outsource the communication to OPA to heimdall and deal only with the group membership information in your service. Compared to the Sharing Service example, this time heimdall would not perform any authorization, but rather enrich the subject information with further information. This way, we’re not going to use a Authorizer, but a Generic Contextualizer instead. As with Sharing Service example, there is a need for a Rego policy, which could look like this:\npackage invoice groups_graph[data.groups[subject].name] = edges { edges := data.groups[subject].member_of } member_of_groups[subject] = groups { groups_graph[subject] groups := graph.reachable(groups_graph, {subject}) } groups { member_of_groups[input.user][_] } It expects just one piece of information, namely the actual user, making the request. So something like this: { \u0026#34;input\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;user\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;alice\u0026#34; } }. Since the Rego policy defined above returns a list of groups, the corresponding response from the OPA endpoint would be { \u0026#34;result\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;group1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;group2\u0026#34;] }. Given this and assuming the above policy can be used by making requests to https://opa.local/v1/data/invoice/policy/groups and the authentication to that endpoint requires basic authentication, the configuration of the Generic Contextualizer would look like follows:\nid: billing_contextualizer type: generic config: endpoint: url: https://opa.local/v1/data/invoice/policy/groups auth: type: basic_auth config: user: MyOpaUser password: SuperSecretPassword payload: | { \u0026#34;input\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;user\u0026#34;: {{ quote .Subject.ID }} } } Upon successful execution of the corresponding request, the response from the OPA endpoint will be stored in the Subject.Attributes[\u0026#34;billing_contextualizer\u0026#34;] field. That way, you can use that information in a Finalizer to forward the group membership to the billing service API.\n","description":"Explains how to integrate heimdall with the Open Policy Agent, an open source, general purpose policy engine.","html_content":"\u003cdiv class=\"paragraph\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.openpolicyagent.org/\"\u003eOpen Policy Agent\u003c/a\u003e, or OPA, is an open source, general purpose policy engine, which decouples authorization, respectively policy decisions from other responsibilities of an application and can be used to implement fine-grained access control for your application.

In such setup, NGINX delegates authentication and authorization to heimdall. If heimdall answers with a 2XX code, NGINX grants access and forwards the original request to the upstream service. If heimdall returns 401 or 403, the access is denied with the corresponding error code. Any other response code returned by heimdall is considered an error.\nIf there is no matching rule on heimdall side, heimdall responds with 404 Not Found, which, as said above will be treated by NGINX as error. To avoid such situations, you can define a default rule, which is anyway recommended to have secure defaults, which, depending on the configuration, would then respond either with 401 or 403, or still 405 if you do not allow a specific HTTP method. To overcome 500 responses returned by nginx in such cases (when heimdall returns 405), you can configure heimdall to respond with another HTTP response code using the respond property on the level of the decision service or proxy service configuration. Since NGINX is highly configurable and heimdall supports different integration options, you can use any of the configuration examples given below. All of these enable heimdall to build the URL of the protected backend server for rule matching purposes.\nIn most cases you must configure heimdall to trust your NGINX instances by setting trusted_proxies for the Decision, respectively Proxy service. Exceptions are described in the sections below.\nForward only the path and query information With this method you don’t set any headers. That means, you cannot rely on the used HTTP scheme, or the host and port in your rules. Here NGINX uses the same HTTP method, used in the original request to it and add the path and query to the path/query URL used for communication with heimdall. That integration method does not require the configuration of trusted_proxies in heimdall.\nExample 1. Possible Configuration # nginx.conf ... location / { auth_request /_auth; (1) auth_request_set $auth_cookie $upstream_http_set_cookie; (2) add_header Set-Cookie $auth_cookie; auth_request_set $authHeader0 $upstream_http_authorization; (3) proxy_set_header \u0026#39;Authorization\u0026#39; $authHeader0; # mitigate HTTPoxy Vulnerability # https://www.nginx.com/blog/mitigating-the-httpoxy-vulnerability-with-nginx/ proxy_set_header Proxy \u0026#34;\u0026#34;; ... } location = /_auth { (4) internal; access_log off; proxy_method $request_method; (5) proxy_pass http://heimdall:4456$request_uri; (6) proxy_pass_request_body off; (7) proxy_set_header Content-Length \u0026#34;\u0026#34;; proxy_set_header Host $http_host; (8) } 1 Configures NGINX to forward every request to the internal /_auth endpoint (this is where the actual heimdall integration happens - see below). 2 When the response from heimdall returns, this and the next line set the Cookies set by heimdall in the response (whether you need this depends on your Contextualizers and Finalizers configuration) 3 When the response from heimdall returns, this and the next line set the Authorization header set by heimdall in the response (which header to set depends again on your Contextualizers and Finalizers configuration) 4 This is where the \u0026#34;magic\u0026#34; happens 5 Configure NGINX to use the HTTP method used by its client. Without this setting the implementation of proxy_path will use the HTTP GET method. 6 Configures NGINX to pass the request to heimdall and sets the request path and queries from the original request 7 Disables sending of the request body. If your heimdall rules make use of the body, you should set this to on and remove the next line. 8 Lets the NGINX setting the Host header, so it is accessible to heimdall. Forward all information in X-Forwarded-* headers With this method you set the X-Forwarded-Method, X-Forwarded-Proto, X-Forwarded-Host and X-Forwarded-Uri to let heimdall know the host, respectively domain url and the used HTTP method.\nCompared to the previous integration option, the configuration only differs in the definition of the internal /_auth endpoint. So, the example configuration is limited to that part only.\nProper configuration of trusted_proxies is mandatory if using this option. Example 2. Possible Configuration # nginx.conf ... location = /_auth { internal; proxy_pass http://heimdall:4456; (1) proxy_pass_request_body off; proxy_set_header Content-Length \u0026#34;\u0026#34;; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Method $request_method; (2) proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; (3) proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $http_host; (4) proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Uri $request_uri; (5) proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr; } 1 Configures NGINX to pass the request to heimdall. 2 Let NGINX forward the used HTTP method to heimdall. 3 Let NGINX forward the used HTTP scheme to heimdall. 4 Let NGINX forward the used host to heimdall. 5 Let NGINX forward the used path and query parameter to heimdall. Integration with NGINX Ingress Controller. To integrate heimdall with the NGINX Ingress Controller you can make use of the nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-url, nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-response-headers and the nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-snippet annotation as shown in the example below. This will result in an NGINX configuration corresponding to the integration option, described in the Forward all information in X-Forwarded-* headers section.\nThe configuration used in the example below requires proper configuration of trusted_proxies. Example 3. Possible Configuration nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-url: \u0026#34;http://\u0026lt;heimdall service name\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt;.svc.cluster.local:\u0026lt;decision port\u0026gt;\u0026#34; (1) nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-response-headers: Authorization (2) nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-snippet: | (3) proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Method $request_method; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $http_host; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Uri $request_uri; # other annotations required 1 Configures the controller to use heimdall’s decision service endpoint with \u0026lt;heimdall service name\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;decision port\u0026gt; depending on your configuration. 2 Let NGINX forward the Authorization header set by heimdall to the upstream service upon successful response. This configuration depends on your Contextualizers and Finalizers configuration. If not configured, NGINX will only react on Set-Cookie headers in responses from heimdall by default. 3 Configures the required headers to pass the information about the used HTTP scheme, host and port, request path and used query parameters to be forwarded to heimdall. Without that, heimdall will not be able extracting relevant information from the NGINX request as it does not support NGINX proprietary X-Original-Method and X-Original-Uri used by it for the same purposes. Alternatively, if you don’t want configuring trusted_proxies and do not rely on the used HTTP scheme, host and port in your rules, you can also use the nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet and nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/server-snippet annotations and use the configuration shown below.\nExample 4. Possible Configuration This example is an exact copy of the configuration used in the very first integration option described above.\nnginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: | auth_request /_auth; auth_request_set $auth_cookie $upstream_http_set_cookie; add_header Set-Cookie $auth_cookie; auth_request_set $auth_header $upstream_http_authorization; proxy_set_header \u0026#39;Authorization\u0026#39; $auth_header; proxy_set_header Proxy \u0026#34;\u0026#34;; nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/server-snippet: | location = /_auth { internal; access_log off; proxy_method $request_method; proxy_pass http://\u0026lt;heimdall service name\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt;.svc.cluster.local:\u0026lt;decision port\u0026gt;$request_uri; proxy_pass_request_body off; proxy_set_header Content-Length \u0026#34;\u0026#34;; proxy_set_header Host $http_host; } # other annotations required Checkout the examples on GitHub for a working demo.\n","description":"Explains how to integrate heimdall with NGINX, an HTTP and reverse proxy server which became famous as one of the fastest web servers out there.","html_content":"\u003cdiv class=\"paragraph\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://nginx.org/\"\u003eNGINX\u003c/a\u003e is an HTTP and reverse proxy server which became famous as one of the fastest web servers out there, heimdall can be integrated with by making use of the \u003ca href=\"https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_auth_request_module.html\"\u003engx_http_auth_request_module\u003c/a\u003e.

No other options are configured. You can, and should however adjust the configuration for your needs.\nThis service exposes only the Decision service endpoint.\nConfiguration The configuration for the Decision service can be adjusted in the decision property, which lives in the serve property of heimdall’s configuration and supports the following properties.\nhost: string (optional)\nBy making use of this property, you can specify the TCP/IP address on which heimdall should listen for connections from client applications. The entry 0.0.0.0 allows listening for all IPv4 addresses. 0.0.0.0 is also the default setting.\nport: integer (optional)\nBy making use of this property, you can specify the TCP port the heimdall should listen on. Defaults to 4456.\ntimeout: Timeout (optional)\nBy using this property you can override the default timeouts used by heimdall. Following properties are supported:\nidle: Duration (optional)\nThe maximum amount of time to wait for the next request when keep-alive is enabled. If set to 0, the value of the read timeout is used. Defaults to 2 minutes.\nread: Duration (optional)\nThe absolute amount of time allowed to read the entire request, including body. Defaults to 5 seconds. Setting this property to 0s will disable the timeout.\nwrite: Duration (optional)\nThe maximum duration before timing out writes of the response. Defaults to 10 seconds. Setting this property to 0s will disable the timeout.\nbuffer_limit: BufferLimit (optional)\nBuffer limits for inbound requests and outbound responses. Following configuration properties are supported:\nread: ByteSize (optional)\nThe maximum size for the read buffer allowed to read the full request including body. Defaults to 4KB.\nwrite: ByteSize (optional)\nThe maximum size for the write buffer of the response. Defaults to 4KB.\ntls: TLS (optional)\nBy default, the Decision service accepts HTTP requests. Depending on your deployment scenario, you could require Heimdall to accept HTTPs requests only (which is highly recommended). You can do so by making use of this option.\ntrusted_proxies: string array (optional)\nThe usage of the Decision service makes only sense, if operated behind some sort of proxy, like API Gateway, etc. In such cases certain header information may be sent to Heimdall using e.g. special X-Forwarded-* headers or the Forwarded header. For example, the Host HTTP header is usually used to set the requested host. But when you’re behind a proxy, the actual host may be stored in an X-Forwarded-Host header, which could, however, also be spoofed.\nDepending on the integration options offered by those systems, which are used to integrate heimdall with, you may need to rely on the aforesaid headers. In such cases, you have to configure the trusted_proxies option and list the IPs, or IP ranges (CIDR notation) of your proxies, which integrate with heimdall. If not configured, heimdall will not accept those headers from any client to prevent spoofing as it might result in privilege escalation.\nPlease consider security implications when making use of this property. respond: Respond (optional)\nBy making use of this property you can instruct heimdall to preserve error information and provide it in the response body to the caller, as well as to use HTTP status codes deviating from those heimdall would usually use.\nExample 1.

By default, Heimdall listens on 0.0.0.0:4455 endpoint for incoming requests in this mode of operation and also configures useful default timeouts, amount of possible upstream connections is active and idle state, as well as buffer limits. No other options are configured. You can, and should however adjust the configuration for your needs.\nThis service exposes only the proxy endpoint.\nConfiguration The configuration of the Proxy endpoint can be adjusted in the proxy property, which lives in the serve property of heimdall’s configuration and supports the following properties.\nhost: string (optional)\nBy making use of this property, you can specify the TCP/IP address on which heimdall should listen for connections from client applications. The entry 0.0.0.0 allows listening for all IPv4 addresses. 0.0.0.0 is also the default setting.\nport: integer (optional)\nBy making use of this property, you can specify the TCP port the heimdall should listen on. Defaults to 4455.\ntimeout: Timeout (optional)\nBy using this property you can override the default timeouts used by heimdall. Following properties are supported:\nidle: Duration (optional)\nThe maximum amount of time to wait for the next request when keep-alive is enabled. If set to 0, the value of the read timeout is used. Defaults to 2 minutes. This value is also used for the maximum amount of time an idle (keep-alive) connection to the upstream will remain idle before closing itself.\nread: Duration (optional)\nThe absolute amount of time allowed to read the entire request, including body. Defaults to 5 seconds. The read timeout is also used while waiting for the responses from the upstream service. Here it specifies the amount of time to wait for a server’s response headers after fully writing the request (including its body, if any). Upon successful upgrade responses from the upstream service, this timeout is disabled, allowing e.g. for WebSockets proxying. Setting this property to 0s will disable the timeout.\nSetting this timout to 0 will make heimdall vulnerable to Slowloris attacks. write: Duration (optional)\nThe maximum duration before timing out writes of the response. Defaults to 10 seconds. Setting this property to 0s will disable the timeout. Compared to the read timeout, the write timeout is not absolute and reset each time data is written to the output stream. This allows Server-Sent-Events and other unidirectional communication without the need to extend the timeout. As with the read timeout, this timeout is disabled upon successful upgrade responses from the upstream service, allowing e.g. for WebSockets proxying.\nbuffer_limit: BufferLimit (optional)\nBuffer limits for inbound requests and outbound responses. You can however override this by making use of this property and specifying the limits you need. Following configuration properties are supported:\nread: ByteSize (optional)\nThe maximum size for the read buffer allowed to read the full request including body. Defaults to 4KB.\nwrite: ByteSize (optional)\nThe maximum size for the write buffer of the response. Defaults to 4KB.\nconnections_limit: ConnectionsLimit (optional)\nAllowed connections limit per upstream service. Following limits can be configured:\nmax_per_host: integer (optional)\nLimits the total number of connections per host, including connections in the dialing, active, and idle states. On limit violation, dials will block. Defaults to 0, which means there is no limit.\nmax_idle: integer (optional)\nControls the maximum number of idle (keep-alive) connections across all hosts. 0 means no limit. Defaults to 100.\nmax_idle_per_host: integer (optional)\nControls the maximum number of idle (keep-alive) connections per hosts. Defaults to 100. Cannot exceed the value of max_idle.\ncors: CORS (optional)\nCORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) headers can be added and configured by making use of this option. This functionality allows for advanced security features to quickly be set. If CORS headers are set, then the Heimdall does not pass preflight requests neither to its pipeline, nor to the upstream service. Instead, the response will be generated and sent back to the client directly.\ntls: TLS (optional)\nBy default, the Proxy endpoint accepts HTTP requests. Depending on your deployment scenario, you could require Heimdall to accept HTTPs requests only (which is highly recommended). You can do so by making use of this option.\ntrusted_proxies: string array (optional)\nHeimdall can make use of X-Forwarded-*, like X-Forwarded-For, X-Forwarded-Method, etc, or the Forwarded header sent by its clients and also forward some of these (X-Forwarded-For and Forwarded) to the configured upstream services. However, since these headers can easily be spoofed, the usage of them is only possible, when the request comes from a trusted source. This is typically the case, when Heimdall is operated behind yet another proxy. For example, the Host HTTP header is usually used to return the requested host. But when you’re behind a proxy, the actual host may be stored in an X-Forwarded-Host header, which could, however, also be spoofed.\nDepending on your setup you may need to rely on the aforesaid headers. In such cases, you have to configure the trusted_proxies option and list the IPs, or IP ranges (CIDR notation) of your proxies in front of heimdall. If not configured, heimdall will not accept those headers from any client to prevent spoofing as it might result in privilege escalation.\nPlease consider security implications when making use of this property. respond: Respond (optional)\nBy making use of this property you can instruct heimdall to preserve error information and provide it in the response body to the caller, as well as to use HTTP status codes deviating from those heimdall would usually use.\nThis mapping is only applicable if the HTTP status code is set by heimdall and not by the upstream service in the response to the proxied request. For that reason you cannot configure the mapping for the accepted response (it will be ignored). Example 1.

That dump is unedited. That means sensitive data will be available in logs. Due to some limitations of the GRPC framework capabilities, setting log level to trace will not dump GRPC requests and responses.

If such objects exist, authenticators verify the related authentication status and obtain information about the corresponding subject. A subject, could be a user who tries to use particular functionality of the upstream service, a machine (if you have machine-2-machine interaction), or something different. Authenticators ensure the subject is authenticated and the information available about it is valid.\nAuthorizers, which ensure that the subject obtained via an authenticator has the required permissions to submit the given HTTP request and thus to execute the corresponding logic in the upstream service. E.g. a specific endpoint of the upstream service might only be accessible to a \u0026#34;user\u0026#34; from the \u0026#34;admin\u0026#34; group, or to an HTTP request if a specific HTTP header is set.\nContextualizers, which enrich the information about the subject obtained via an authenticator with further contextual information, required either by the upstream service itself or an authorizer. This can be handy if the actual authentication system doesn’t have all information about the subject (which is usually the case in microservice architectures), or if dynamic information about the subject, like the current location based on the IP address, is required.\nFinalizers, which, as the name implies, finalize the execution of the pipeline and enrich the request with data such as subject information or authentication tokens required by the upstream service. The available options range from doing nothing, adding a simple header over a structured JWT, to driving specific protocols, e.g. to obtain a token required by the upstream service.\nError Handlers, which are responsible for execution of logic if any of the mechanisms described above fail. These range from a simple error response to the client, which sent the request, to sophisticated ones, supporting complex logic and redirects.\nGeneral Configuration All of the above said mechanisms must be configured in the mechanisms section of heimdall’s configuration. Only those mechanisms, which have been configured, can then be (re-)used by rules.\nmechanisms: authenticators: \u0026lt;list of authenticators\u0026gt; authorizers: \u0026lt;list of authorizers\u0026gt; contextualizers: \u0026lt;list of contextualizers\u0026gt; finalizers: \u0026lt;list of finalizers\u0026gt; error_handlers: \u0026lt;list of error handlers\u0026gt; Each mechanism configuration entry must contain at least the following properties:\nid - The unique identifier of the mechanism. Identifiers are used to reference the required mechanism within a rule. You can choose whatever identifier, you want. It is just a name. It must however be unique across all defined mechanisms of a particular mechanism category (like authenticator, authorizer, etc.).\ntype - The specific type of the mechanism.\nDepending on the mechanism type, there can be an additional config property, which then holds the mechanism’s specific configuration.\nEvery mechanism type can be configured as many times as needed. However, for those, which don’t have a configuration, it doesn’t really make sense, as all of them would behave the same way.\nFor example, your authenticator definitions could look like this:\nmechanisms: authenticators: - id: foo type: bar - id: baz type: bla config: bla: bar - id: zab type: bar - id: oof type: bla config: bar: bla The above snippet configures two instances of an imaginary authenticator of a type bar, made available for usage in rules via ids foo and zab, as well as two instances of an imaginary authenticator of a type bla, made available for usage in rule via ids baz and oof. The baz and oof authenticators are different, as they are configured differently, but foo and zab authenticators do not have any configuration. So, they behave the same way and there is actually no need to define two instances of them.\nIn simplest case a rule will just reuse mechanisms in its pipeline. In more complex cases a rule can reconfigure parts of it (More about rules configuration can be found here). Which parts can be reconfigured, respectively overridden are mechanism specific and described in the mechanism specific documentation. Reconfiguration is always limited to the particular rule pipeline and does not affect other rules.\nHere is an example which configures a couple of mechanisms:\nmechanisms: authenticators: - id: anon_authn type: anonymous - id: opaque_auth_token_authn type: oauth2_introspection config: introspection_endpoint: url: http://hydra:4445/oauth2/introspect assertions: issuers: - http://127.0.0.1:4444/ authorizers: - id: deny_all_authz type: deny - id: local_authz type: cel config: expressions: - expression: \u0026#34;manager\u0026#34; in Subject.Attributes.groups message: user is not in the expected group contextualizers: - id: group_manager type: generic config: endpoint: url: http://group-manager.local/groups method: GET forward_headers: - Authorization cache_ttl: 1m finalizers: - id: jwt_finalizer type: jwt config: ttl: 5m claims: | { {{ $user_name := .Subject.Attributes.identity.user_name -}} \u0026#34;email\u0026#34;: {{ quote .Subject.Attributes.identity.email }}, \u0026#34;email_verified\u0026#34;: {{ .Subject.Attributes.identity.email_verified }}, {{ if $user_name -}} \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: {{ quote $user_name }} {{ else -}} \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: {{ quote $email }} {{ end -}} } error_handlers: - id: default type: default - id: authenticate_with_kratos type: redirect config: to: http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/login/browser?return_to={{ .Request.URL | urlenc }} when: - error: - type: authentication_error - type: authorization_error request_headers: Accept: - text/html Evaluation Objects Some mechanisms support, respectively require access to different types of objects they work on, e.g. to render a header with specific values, or to check whether some expectations apply. Following objects are available and have the following structure:\nSubject This object contains the information about the authenticated subject and has the following attributes:\nID: string\nThe identifier of the subject. This value is set by the authenticator, which was able to authenticate the subject.\nAttributes: map\nContains all attributes, which are known about the subject. The content is initially set by the authenticator, which was able to authenticate the subject. Mechanisms following the authenticator in a rule pipeline can update it, but cannot override any entries.\nEach object of this type can be thought as a JSON object. Here some examples:\nExample 1. Subject created by an Anonymous Authenticator Subject = { ID: \u0026#34;anonymous\u0026#34;, Attributes: {} } Example 2. Possible Subject created by an OAuth2 Authenticator Subject = { ID: \u0026#34;foobar\u0026#34;, Attributes: { \u0026#34;sub\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;foobar\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;exp\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1670600805\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;jti\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;7b91ed8a-0251-4e02-8d51-9792785851e8\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;iat\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1670600305\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;iss\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;http://testauthserver.local\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;nbf\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1670600305\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;extra\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;bar\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;baz\u0026#34;] } } } Request This object contains information about the request handled by heimdall and has the following attributes and methods:\nMethod: string\nThe HTTP method used, like GET, POST, etc.\nURL: URL\nThe URL of the matched request. This object has the following properties and methods:\nScheme: string\nThe HTTP scheme part of the url\nHost: string\nThe host part of the url\nPath: string\nThe path part of the url\nRawQuery: string\nThe raw query part of the url.\nString(): method\nThis method returns the URL as valid URL string of a form scheme:host/path?query.\nQuery(): method\nThe parsed query with each key-value pair being a string to array of strings mapping.\nClientIP: string array\nThe list of IP addresses the request passed through with the first entry being the ultimate client of the request. Only available if heimdall is configured to trust the client, sending this information, e.g. in the X-Forwarded-From header (see e.g. Decision Service trusted_proxies configuration for more details).\nHeader(name): method,\nThis method expects the name of a header as input and returns its value as a string. If the header is not present in the HTTP request an empty string (\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) is returned. If a header appears multiple times in the request, the returned string is a comma separated list of all values.\nA single header may be a comma separated list of actual values as well. Best example is the Accept header, which might be set to e.g. text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,/;q=0.8). Cookie(name): method,\nThis method expects the name of a cookie as input and returns the value of it as string. If the cookie is not present in the HTTP request an empty string (\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) is returned.\nHere is an example:\nExample 3. Example request object Request = { Method: \u0026#34;GET\u0026#34;, Url: { Scheme: \u0026#34;https\u0026#34;, Host: \u0026#34;localhost\u0026#34;, Path: \u0026#34;/test\u0026#34;, RawQuery: \u0026#34;baz=zab\u0026amp;baz=bar\u0026amp;foo=bar\u0026#34; }, ClientIP: [\u0026#34;127.0.0.1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;10.10.10.10\u0026#34;] } Payload This object represents the contents of a payload, like the request body or a response body. The contents depend on the MIME-Type of the payload. For json, yaml or x-www-form-urlencoded encoded payload, the object is transformed to a JSON object. Otherwise, it is just a string.\nHere some examples:\nExample 4. Structured payload The following JSON object is a typical response from OPA.\nPayload = { \u0026#34;result\u0026#34;: true } Example 5. Unstructured payload Payload = \u0026#34;SomeStringValue\u0026#34; Values This object represents a key value map, with both, the key and the value being of string type. Though, the actual values can be templated (see (Templating). The contents and the variables available in templates depend on the configuration of the particular mechanism, respectively the corresponding override in a rule.\nHere is an example:\nExample 6. Example values object Values = { \u0026#34;some-key-1\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;value-1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;some-key-2\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;value-2\u0026#34; } Templating Some pipeline mechanisms support templating using Golang Text Templates. Templates can act on all objects described above (Subject, Request, Payload and Values). Which exactly are supported is mechanism specific.\nTo ease the usage, all sprig functions, except env and expandenv, as well as the following functions are available:\nurlenc - Encodes a given string using url encoding. Is handy if you need to generate request body or query parameters e.g. for communication with further systems.\natIndex - Implements python-like access to arrays and takes as a single argument the index to access the element in the array at. With index being a positive values it works exactly the same way, as with the usage of the build-in index function to access array elements. With negative index value, one can access the array elements from the tail of the array. -1 is the index of the last element, -2 the index of the element before the last one, etc.\nExample: {{ atIndex 2 [1,2,3,4,5] }} evaluates to 3 (behaves the same way as the index function) and {{ atIndex -2 [1,2,3,4,5] }} evaluates to 4.\nsplitList - Splits a given string using a separator (part of the sprig library, but not documented). The result is a string array.\nExample: {{ splitList \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; \u0026#34;/foo/bar\u0026#34; }} evaluates to the [\u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;bar\u0026#34;] array.\nExample 7. Rendering a JSON object Imagine, we have a POST request for the URL http://foobar.baz/zab?foo=bar, with a header X-Foo set to bar value, for which heimdall was able to identify a subject, with ID=foo and which Attributes contain an entry email: foo@bar, then you can generate a JSON object with this information with the following template:\n{ \u0026#34;subject_id\u0026#34;: {{ quote .Subject.ID }}, \u0026#34;email\u0026#34;: {{ quote .Subject.Attributes.email }}, \u0026#34;request_url\u0026#34;: {{ quote .Request.URL }}, \u0026#34;foo_value\u0026#34;: {{ index .Request.URL.Query.foo 0 | quote }} \u0026#34;request_method\u0026#34;: {{ quote .Request.Method }}, \u0026#34;x_foo_value\u0026#34;: {{ .Request.Header \u0026#34;X-Foo\u0026#34; | quote }} } Please note how the access to the foo query parameter is done. Since .Request.URL.Query.foo returns an array of strings, the first element is taken to render the value for the foo_value key.\nThis will result in the following JSON object:\n{ \u0026#34;subject_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;email\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;foo@bar.baz\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;request_url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;http://foobar.baz/zab?foo=bar\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;foo_value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;bar\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;request_method\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;POST\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;x_foo_value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;bar\u0026#34; } Example 8. Access the last part of the path Imagine, we have a POST request to the URL http://foobar.baz/zab/1234, with 1234 being the identifier of a file, which should be updated with the contents sent in the body of the request, and you would like to control access to the aforesaid object using e.g. OpenFGA. This can be achieved with the following authorizer:\nid: openfga_authorizer type: remote config: endpoint: url: https://openfga/stores/files/check payload: | { \u0026#34;user\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;user:{{ .Subject.ID }}\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;relation\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;write\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;object\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;file:{{ splitList \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; .Request.URL.Path | last }}\u0026#34; } expressions: - expression: | Payload.allowed == true Please note how the \u0026#34;object\u0026#34; is set in the payload property above. When the payload template is rendered and for the above said request heimdall was able to identify the subject with ID=foo, following JSON object will be created:\n{ \u0026#34;user\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;user:foo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;relation\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;write\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;object\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;file:1234\u0026#34; } You can find further examples as part of mechanism descriptions, supporting templating.\nExpressions Expressions can be used to execute authorization logic. As of today only CEL is supported as expression language. All standard, as well as extension functions are available. Which of the evaluation objects are available to the expression depends on the mechanism.\nIn addition to the build-in, respectively extension methods and functions, as well as the methods available on the evaluation objects, following functions are available as well:\nsplit - this function works on strings and expects a separator as a single argument. The result is a string array.\nExample: \u0026#34;/foo/bar/baz\u0026#34;.split(\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;) returns [\u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;bar\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;baz\u0026#34;].\nregexFind - this function returns the first (left most) match of a regular expression in the given string.\nExample: \u0026#34;abcd1234\u0026#34;.regexFind(\u0026#34;[a-zA-Z][1-9]\u0026#34;) returns \u0026#34;d1\u0026#34;.\nregexFindAll - this function returns an array of all matches of a regular expression in the given string.\nExample: \u0026#34;123456789\u0026#34;.regexFindAll(\u0026#34;[2,4,6,8]\u0026#34;) returns [\u0026#34;2\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;4\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;6\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;8\u0026#34;].\nat - this function implements python-like access to arrays and takes as a single argument the index to access the element in the array at. With index being a positive values it works exactly the same way, as with the usage of [] to access array elements. With negative index value, one can access the array elements from the tail of the array. -1 is the index of the last element, -2 the index of the element before the last one, etc.\nExample: [1,2,3,4,5].at(2) returns 3 and [1,2,3,4,5].at(-2) returns 4.\nlast - this function works on arrays and returns the last element of an array or nil if the array is empty.\nExample: [1,2,3,4,5].last() returns 5\nSome examples:\nExample 9. Evaluate Payload object Given the following Payload object\nPayload = { \u0026#34;result\u0026#34;: true } a CEL expression to check the result attribute is set to true, would look as follows:\nPayload.result == true Example 10. Check whether the user is member of the admin group has(Subject.Attributes.groups) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; Subject.Attributes.groups.exists(g, g == \u0026#34;admin\u0026#34;) Example 11.

If such objects exist, authenticators verify the related authentication status and obtain information about the corresponding subject. A subject, could be a user, trying to use particular functionality of the upstream service, a machine (if you have machine-2-machine interaction), or something different. Authenticators ensure the subject is authenticated and the information available about it is valid.\nAuthenticator Types The following sections describe the available authenticator types in more detail. Some of these may support or require additional configuration. The corresponding properties are annotated with mandatory, respectively optional to denote configuration requirement, as well as with overridable, not overriddable and partially overridable to indicate whether the property can be overridden in a rule pipeline.\nUnauthorized This authenticator rejects all requests as unauthenticated (on HTTP response code level this is then mapped to 401 Unauthorized, hence the type name). It basically stops the successful execution of the pipeline resulting in the execution of the error handlers. This authenticator type doesn’t have any configuration options.\nTo enable the usage of this authenticator, you have to set the type property to unauthorized.\nExample 1. Configure Unauthorized authenticator id: foo type: unauthorized Anonymous This authenticator just creates a Subject object and sets its ID to anonymous without doing anything else. You can overwrite the value of subject’s id by using the optional config property.\nTo enable the usage of this authenticator, you have to set the type property to anonymous.\nConfiguration using the config property is optional. Following properties are available:\nsubject: string (optional, overridable)\nEnables setting the ID of the created Subject object to a custom value.\nExample 2. Configuration of Anonymous authenticator id: foo type: anonymous config: subject: anon Basic Auth This authenticator verifies the provided credentials according to the HTTP \u0026#34;Basic\u0026#34; authentication scheme, described in RFC 7617. It does however not challenge the authentication, it only verifies the provided credentials and sets the Subject ID to the configured user identifier if the authentication succeeds. Otherwise, it raises an error, resulting in the execution of the configured error handlers. The \u0026#34;WWW Authenticate\u0026#34; error handler mechanism can for example be used if the corresponding challenge is required.\nTo enable the usage of this authenticator, you have to set the type property to basic_auth.\nConfiguration using the config property is mandatory. Following properties are available:\nuser_id: string (mandatory, overridable)\nThe identifier of the subject to be verified.\npassword: string (mandatory, overridable)\nThe password of the subject to be verified.\nallow_fallback_on_error: boolean (optional, overridable)\nIf set to true, allows the pipeline to fall back to the next authenticator in the pipeline if this one fails to verify the credentials. Defaults to false.\nExample 3. Configuration of Basic Auth authenticator id: foo type: basic_auth config: user_id: bar password: baz Generic This authenticator is kind of a Swiss knife and can do a lot depending on the given configuration. It verifies the authentication status of the subject by making use of values available in cookies, headers, or query parameters of the HTTP request and communicating with the actual authentication system to perform the verification of the subject authentication status on the one hand, and to get the information about the subject on the other hand. There is however one limitation: it can only deal with JSON responses.\nTo enable the usage of this authenticator, you have to set the type property to generic.\nConfiguration using the config property is mandatory. Following properties are available:\nidentity_info_endpoint: Endpoint (mandatory, not overridable)\nThe endpoint to communicate to for the actual subject authentication status verification purpose. At least the url must be configured. If you don’t configure method, HTTP POST will be used. The Accept header is set to application/json by default. You can overwrite these setting if required. Query and header definitions can be templated and can make use of the AuthenticationData object (see below). Don’t forget - this authenticator supports only JSON responses.\nauthentication_data_source: Authentication Data Source (mandatory, not overridable)\nWhere to extract the authentication data from the request. The extracted value is made available as AuthenticationData for usage in templates defined as part of this authenticator configuration. So you can reference it in a body, header, etc.\nThe AuthenticationData object is available during the execution of this authenticator only and is not made available to other mechanisms. forward_headers: string array (optional, not overridable)\nIf the identity_info_endpoint API requires any headers from the request to heimdall, you can forward these unchanged by making use of this property. This might be the header used to extract the authentication data from.\nforward_cookies: string array (optional, not overridable)\nIf the identity_info_endpoint API requires any cookies from the request to heimdall, you can forward these unchanged by making use of this property. This might be the cookie used to extract the authentication data from.\npayload: string (optional, not overridable)\nYour template with definitions required to send the extracted authentication data. The template has access to the AuthenticationData object only.\nsubject: Subject (mandatory, not overridable)\nWhere to extract the Subject information from the identity info endpoint response.\ncache_ttl: Duration (optional, overridable)\nHow long to cache the response. If not set, response caching if disabled. The cache key is calculated from the identity_info_endpoint configuration and the actual authentication data value.\nallow_fallback_on_error: boolean (optional, overridable)\nIf set to true, allows the pipeline to fall back to the next authenticator in the pipeline if this one fails to verify the credentials. Defaults to false.\nsession_lifespan: Session Lifespan (optional, not overridable)\nWhere to extract the session validity information form the identity info endpoint response. If the not_after property is specified, the corresponding value from the response is also used for cache ttl calculation to prevent usage of not anymore valid session objects and overwrites the value configured for cache_ttl if the usage of that value would exceed the lifespan of the session object.\nIf you’re configuring the cache_ttl property, it is highly recommended to configure session_lifespan as well to ensure outdated session objects are not used for subsequent requests to heimdall. Usage of session_lifespan is recommended anyway to enable time based validation of the response from the identity info endpoint. Example 4. Configuration to work with session cookies This example shows how to configure this authenticator to work with Ory Kratos, an authentication system, which issues a cookie upon successful user authentication to maintain the authentication state. To reduce the communication overhead, it also makes use of cache_ttl to cache the response for 5 minutes if that time frame does not exceed the actual validity of the session represented by the cookie.\nid: kratos_session_cookie type: generic config: identity_info_endpoint: https://kratos/sessions/whoami authentication_data_source: - cookie: ory_kratos_session forward_cookies: - ory_kratos_session subject: id: \u0026#34;identity.id\u0026#34; cache_ttl: 5m session_lifespan: active: active issued_at: issued_at not_before: authenticated_at not_after: expires_at time_format: \u0026#34;2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999Z07\u0026#34; validity_leeway: 10s As kratos requires the ory_kratos_session cookie as is, this configuration makes use of the forward_cookies property and does not use the AuthenticationData object.\nThis example does also show how an endpoint can be configured by just specifying the URL as string, which is the simplest way for endpoint configuration.\nExample 5. Configuration to work with a Bearer token This example shows how to configure this authenticator to work with an OAuth2 authorization service, which issues a Bearer token upon successful user authentication. To reduce the communication overhead, it also makes use of cache_ttl to cache the response for 5 minutes if it does not exceed the validity of the information present in the response from the used endpoint.\nIn this example we configure the authenticator to use the introspection endpoint to get the information about the token.\nid: opaque_bearer_token type: generic config: identity_info_endpoint: url: https://my-auth.system/introspect headers: Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded auth: type: basic_auth config: user: Heimdall password: ${INTROSPECTION_PASSWORD} authentication_data_source: - header: Authorization scheme: Bearer payload: | token={{ urlenc .AuthenticationData }}\u0026amp;token_type_hint=access_token subject: id: sub cache_ttl: 5m session_lifespan: active: active issued_at: iat not_before: nbf not_after: exp validity_leeway: 10s Usually, you would not only like to verify the validity of a token, but also a couple of claims. This can be achieved by a CEL Authorizer. However, there is also a special purpose OAuth2 Introspection authenticator type, which supports asserting all security relevant claims in just one place and does not need so much configuration as shown above.\nIn this configuration the authenticator extracts the token from the Authorization header and request the information about the corresponding user from the http://my-auth.system/introspect endpoint by sending the extracted token in the body of the request in a parameter named token.\nExample 6. Configuration to work with Google’s Firebase. If you would like to integrate with Google’s Firebase, you would configure something like this:\nAssumption: The token issued by firebase is located in the HTTP Authorization header using Bearer scheme\nid: firebase_token type: generic config: identity_info_endpoint: url: https://identitytoolkit.googleapis.com/v1/accounts:lookup?key=${YOUR_API_KEY} headers: Content-Type: application/json authentication_data_source: - header: Authorization scheme: Bearer payload: | { \u0026#34;idToken\u0026#34;: {{ quote .AuthenticationData }} } subject: id: users.0.localId attributes: users.0 cache_ttl: 5m OAuth2 Introspection This authenticator handles requests that have Bearer token in the HTTP Authorization header (Authorization: Bearer \u0026lt;token\u0026gt;), in the access_token query parameter or the access_token body parameter (latter, if the body is of application/x-www-form-urlencoded MIME type). It then uses OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection endpoint to check if the token is valid. The validation includes at least the verification of the status and the time validity. That is if the token is still active and whether it has been issued in an acceptable time frame. Latter can be adjusted by specifying a leeway. All other validation options can and should be configured.\nTo enable the usage of this authenticator, you have to set the type property to oauth2_introspection.\nConfiguration using the config property is mandatory. Following properties are available:\nintrospection_endpoint: Endpoint (mandatory, not overridable)\nThe introspection endpoint of the OAuth2 authorization provider. At least the url must be configured. There is no need to define the method property or setting the Content-Type or the Accept header. These are set by default to the values required by the OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection RFC. You can however override these while configuring the authenticator.\ntoken_source: Authentication Data Source (optional, not overridable)\nWhere to get the access token from. Defaults to retrieve it from the Authorization header, the access_token query parameter or the access_token body parameter (latter, if the body is of application/x-www-form-urlencoded MIME type).\nassertions: Assertions (mandatory, overridable)\nConfigures the required claim assertions. Overriding on rule level is possible even partially. Those parts of the assertion, which have not been overridden are taken from the prototype configuration.\nsubject: Subject (optional, not overridable)\nWhere to extract the Subject information from the introspection endpoint response. If not configured sub is used to extract the subject ID and all attributes from the introspection endpoint response are made available as Attributes.\ncache_ttl: Duration (optional, overridable)\nHow long to cache the response. If not set, caching of the introspection response is based on the available token expiration information. To disable caching, set it to 0s. If you set the ttl to a custom value \u0026gt; 0, the expiration time (if available) of the token will be considered. The cache key is calculated from the introspection_endpoint configuration and the value of the access token.\nallow_fallback_on_error: boolean (optional, overridable)\nIf set to true, allows the pipeline to fall back to the next authenticator in the pipeline if this one fails to verify the credentials. Defaults to false.\nExample 7. Minimal possible configuration id: at_opaque type: oauth2_introspection config: introspection_endpoint: url: http://hydra:4445/oauth2/introspect assertions: issuers: - http://127.0.0.1:4444/ JWT As the OAuth2 Introspection authenticator, this authenticator handles requests that have a Bearer token in the Authorization header, in a different header, a query parameter or a body parameter as well. Unlike the OAuth2 Introspection authenticator it expects the token to be a JSON Web Token (JWT) and verifies it according RFC 7519, Section 7.2. It does however not support encrypted payloads and nested JWTs. In addition to this, validation includes the verification of the time validity. Latter can be adjusted by specifying a leeway. All other validation options can and should be configured.\nTo enable the usage of this authenticator, you have to set the type property to jwt.\nConfiguration using the config property is mandatory. Following properties are available:\njwks_endpoint: Endpoint (mandatory, not overridable)\nThe JWKS endpoint, this authenticator retrieves the key material in a format specified in RFC 7519 from for JWT signature verification purposes. The url must be configured. By default method is set to GET and the HTTP Accept header to application/json\njwt_source: Authentication Data Source (optional, not overridable)\nWhere to get the access token from. Defaults to retrieve it from the Authorization header, the access_token query parameter or the access_token body parameter (latter, if the body is of application/x-www-form-urlencoded MIME type).\nassertions: Assertions (mandatory, overridable)\nConfigures the required claim assertions. Overriding on rule level is possible even partially. Those parts of the assertion, which have not been overridden are taken from the prototype configuration.\nsubject: Subject (optional, not overridable)\nWhere to extract the subject id from the JWT, as well as which attributes to use. If not configured sub is used to extract the subject id and all attributes from the JWT payload are made available as attributes of the subject.\ncache_ttl: Duration (optional, overridable)\nHow long to cache the key from the JWKS response, which was used for signature verification purposes. If not set, heimdall will cache this key for 10 minutes and not call JWKS endpoint again if the same kid is referenced in an JWT and same JWKS endpoint is used. The cache key is calculated from the jwks_endpoint configuration and the kid referenced in the JWT.\nallow_fallback_on_error: boolean (optional, overridable)\nIf set to true, allows the pipeline to fall back to the next authenticator in the pipeline if this one fails to verify the credentials. Defaults to false.\nvalidate_jwk: boolean (optional, not overridable)\nEnables or disables the verification of the JWK certificate used for JWT signature verification purposes. Effective only if the JWK contains a certificate. The verification happens according to RFC 5280, section 6.1 and also includes the check, that the certificate is allowed to be used for signature verification purposes. Revocation check is not supported. Defaults to true.\ntrust_store: string (optional, not overridable)\nThe path to a PEM file containing the trust anchors, to be used for the JWK certificate validation. Defaults to system trust store.\nIf a JWT does not reference a kid, heimdall always fetches a JWKS from the configured endpoint (so no caching is done) and iterates over the received keys until one matches. If none matches, the authenticator fails. Example 8.

E.g. a specific endpoint of the upstream service might only be accessible to a \u0026#34;user\u0026#34; from the \u0026#34;admin\u0026#34; group, or to an HTTP request if a specific HTTP header is set.\nAuthorizer Types The following sections describe the available authorizer types in more detail. Some of these may support or require additional configuration. The corresponding properties are annotated with mandatory, respectively optional to denote configuration requirement, as well as with overridable, not overriddable and partially overridable to indicate whether the property can be overridden in a rule pipeline.\nAllow As the name implies, this authorizer allows any request passing through. This authorizer type also doesn’t have any configuration options.\nTo enable the usage of this authorizer, you have to set the type property to allow.\nExample 1. Configuration of Allow authorizer id: allow_any_request type: allow Deny As the name implies, this authorizer denies any request (on HTTP response code level this is then mapped to 403 Forbidden). It basically stops the successful execution of the pipeline resulting in the execution of the error handler mechanisms. This authorizer type doesn’t have any configuration options.\nTo enable the usage of this authorizer, you have to set the type property to deny.\nExample 2. Configuration of Deny authorizer id: deny_any_request type: deny Local (CEL) This authorizer allows definition of authorization requirements based on information available about the authenticated subject, as well as the actual request by using CEL based authorization expressions. Each expression is expected to return true to signal success. Otherwise, the authorization fails, resulting in the execution of the error handler mechanisms.\nTo enable the usage of this authorizer, you have to set the type property to cel.\nConfiguration using the config property is mandatory. Following properties are available:\nexpressions: Authorization Expression array (mandatory, overridable)\nList of authorization expressions, which define the actual authorization logic. Each expression has access to the Subject and the Request objects.\nExample 3. Authorization based on subject properties In this example the subject is checked to be member of the \u0026#34;admin\u0026#34; group.\nid: user_is_admin type: cel config: expressions: - expression: | has(Subject.Attributes.groups) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; Subject.Attributes.groups.exists(g, g == \u0026#34;admin\u0026#34;) message: User is not admin The first line of the expressions verifies that the property group exists. The second line checks, whether groups contains an entry named admin.\nThis example specifies also a message, which is logged, if the expression fails.\nExample 4. Authorization based on subject and request properties In this example the authorizer is configured to ensure anonymous access to a resource is possible for read requests only.\nid: no_modification_allowed_by_anonymous type: cel config: expressions: - expression: | Request.Method in [\u0026#34;GET\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;HEAD\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;OPTIONS\u0026#34;] || Subject.ID != \u0026#34;anonymous\u0026#34; message: Anonymous non-read access is forbidden The usage of this type of configuration makes sense in a pipeline, which combines multiple Authenticators, allowing anonymous and authenticated access.\nRemote This authorizer allows communication with other systems, like Open Policy Agent, Ory Keto, etc. for the actual authorization purpose. If the used endpoint answers with a not 2xx HTTP response code, this authorizer assumes, the authorization has failed, resulting in the execution of the error handler mechanisms. Otherwise, if no expressions for the verification of the response are defined, the authorizer assumes, the request has been authorized. If expressions are defined and do not fail, the authorization succeeds.\nIf your authorization system provides a payload in the response, heimdall inspects the Content-Type header to prepare the payload for further usage, e.g. for payload verification expressions, or for a Local (CEL) authorizer. If the content type does either end with json or is application/x-www-form-urlencoded, the payload is decoded, so key based access to the corresponding attributes is possible, otherwise it is made available as well, but as a simple string. In all cases this value is available for the authorization expressions as well as in the Subject’s Attributes property under a key named by the id of the authorizer (See also the example below).\nTo enable the usage of this authorizer, you have to set the type property to remote.\nConfiguration using the config property is mandatory. Following properties are available:\nendpoint: Endpoint (mandatory, not overridable)\nThe API endpoint of your authorization system. At least the url must be configured. This mechanism allows templating of the url and makes the Subject object, as well as the Values (see also below) objects available to it. By default, this authorizer will use HTTP POST to send the rendered payload to this endpoint. You can override this behavior by configuring method as well. Depending on the API requirements of your authorization system, you might need to configure further properties, like headers, etc.\npayload: string (optional, overridable)\nYour template with definitions required to communicate to the authorization endpoint. The template can make use of Values, Subject and Request objects.\nexpressions: Authorization Expression array (optional, overridable)\nList of CEL expressions which define the logic to be applied to the response returned by the endpoint. All expressions are expected to evaluate to true if the authorization was successful. If any of the expressions evaluates to false, the authorization fails and the message defined by the failed expression will be logged.\nEach expression has access to the Payload object.\nforward_response_headers_to_upstream: string array (optional, overridable)\nEnables forwarding of any headers from the authorization endpoint response to the upstream service.\ncache_ttl: Duration (optional, overridable)\nAllows caching of the authorization endpoint responses. Defaults to 0s, which means no caching. The cache key is calculated from the entire configuration of the authorizer instance and the available information about the current subject.\nvalues map of strings (optional, overridable)\nA key value map, which is made accessible to the template rendering engine as Values object, to render parts of the URL and/or the payload. The actual values in that map can be templated as well with access to the Subject and Request objects.\nExample 5. Configuration of Remote authorizer to communicate with Open Policy Agent (OPA) Here the remote authorizer is configured to communicate with OPA. Since OPA expects the query to be formatted as JSON, the corresponding Content-Type header is set. Since the responses are JSON objects as well, the Accept header is also provided. In addition, this examples uses the basic_auth auth type to authenticate against the endpoint.\nid: opa type: remote config: endpoint: url: https://opa.local/v1/data/{{ .Values.namespace }}/{{ .Values.policy }} headers: Content-Type: json Accept: json auth: type: basic_auth config: user: ${OPA_USER} password: ${OPA_PASSWORD} payload: | { \u0026#34;input\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;user\u0026#34;: {{ quote .Subject.ID }} }, \u0026#34;some_data\u0026#34;: {{ quote .Values.whatever }} } values: namespace: myapi/policy policy: allow_write whatever: | {{ .Request.Header(\u0026#34;X-Whatever\u0026#34;) }} expressions: - expression: | Payload.result == true message: User does not have required permissions In this case, since an OPA response could look like { \u0026#34;result\u0026#34;: true } or { \u0026#34;result\u0026#34;: false }, heimdall makes the response also available under Subject.Attributes[\u0026#34;opa\u0026#34;] as a map, with \u0026#34;opa\u0026#34; being the id of the authorizer in this example.\nA specific rule could then use this authorizer in the following ways:\n- id: rule1 # other rule properties execute: - # other mechanisms - authorizer: opa # using defaults - # other mechanisms - id: rule2 # other rule properties execute: - # other mechanisms - authorizer: opa config: # overriding with rule specifics values: policy: allow_read whatever: | {{ .Request.Header(\u0026#34;X-SomethingElse\u0026#34;) }} - # other mechanisms ","description":"","html_content":"\u003cdiv class=\"paragraph\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAuthorizers ensure that the \u003ca href=\"/docs/configuration/rules/pipeline_mechanisms/overview/#_subject\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eSubject\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/a\u003e obtained via an authenticator has the required permissions to submit the given HTTP request and thus to execute the corresponding logic in the upstream service.

Mechanisms"],"tags":null,"title":"Authorizers","url":"/docs/configuration/rules/pipeline_mechanisms/authorizers/"},{"categories":null,"content":" Contextualizers enrich the information about the Subject obtained via an authenticator mechanism with further information, required by either the endpoint of the upstream service itself or an authorizer mechanism. This can be handy if the actual authentication system doesn’t have all information about the subject (which is usually the case in microservice architectures), or if dynamic information about the subject, like the current location based on the IP address, is required.\nContextualizer Types AThe following sections describe the available contextualizer types in more detail. Some of these may support or require additional configuration. The corresponding properties are annotated with mandatory, respectively optional to denote configuration requirement, as well as with overridable, not overriddable and partially overridable to indicate whether the property can be overridden in a rule pipeline.\nGeneric This mechanism allows you to communicate to any API you want to fetch further information about the subject. Typical scenario is getting specific attributes for later authorization purposes which are not known to the authentication system and thus were not made available in Subject’s Attributes property. If the API responses with a 2xx HTTP response code, the payload is made available in the Attributes property of the Subject, otherwise, if not overridden, an error is thrown and the execution of the regular pipeline stops. To avoid overwriting of existing attributes, this object is however not available on the top level, but under a key named by the id of the authorizer (See also the example below). If the Content-Type of the response is either ending with json or is application/x-www-form-urlencoded, the payload is decoded and made available as map, otherwise it is treated as string, but, as written above, is made available as well.\nTo enable the usage of this contextualizer, you have to set the type property to generic.\nConfiguration using the config property is mandatory. Following properties are available:\nendpoint: Endpoint (mandatory, not overridable)\nThe API of the service providing additional attributes about the authenticated user. At least the url must be configured. This mechanism allows templating of the url and makes the Subject object, as well as the Values (see also below) objects available to it. By default, this contextualizer will use HTTP POST to send the rendered payload to this endpoint. You can override this behavior by configuring method as well. Depending on the API requirements of the system, this contextualizer should communicate to, you might need to configure further properties, like headers, etc.\nforward_headers: string array (optional, overridable)\nIf the API requires any headers from the request to heimdall, you can forward these unchanged by making use of this property\nforward_cookies: string array (optional, overridable)\nIf the API requires any cookies from the request to heimdall, you can forward these unchanged by making use of this property.\npayload: string (optional, overridable)\nYour template with definitions required to communicate to the endpoint. The template can make use of Values, Subject and Request objects.\ncache_ttl: Duration (optional, overridable)\nAllows caching of the API responses. Defaults to 10 seconds. The cache key is calculated from the entire configuration of the contextualizer instance and the available information about the current subject.\ncontinue_pipeline_on_error: boolean (optional, overridable)\nIf set to true, allows the pipeline to continue with the execution of the next mechanisms. So the error, if thrown, is ignored. Defaults to false, which means the execution of the regular pipeline is stopped and the execution of the error pipeline is started.\nvalues map of strings (optional, overridable)\nA key value map, which is made accessible to the template rendering engine as Values object to render parts of the URL and/or the payload. The actual values in that map can be templated as well with access to the Subject and Request objects.\nExample 1. Contextualizer configuration without payload In this example the contextualizer is configured to call an endpoint using the HTTP GET method with the subject id being part of the url path. As the endpoint requires the X-My-Session-Cookie cookie for subject authentication purposes, forward_cookies is used to achieve this.\nid: foo type: generic config: endpoint: url: https://some-other.service/users/{{.Subject.ID}} method: GET forward_cookies: - X-My-Session-Cookie Example 2. Contextualizer configuration with payload In this example the contextualizer is configured to call an endpoint using the HTTP POST and send some data.\nid: foo type: generic config: endpoint: url: https://some-other.service/users method: POST payload: | { \u0026#34;user_id\u0026#34;: {{ quote .Values.user_id }} \u0026#34;whatever\u0026#34;: {{ quote .Values.whatever }} } Since the values property is not defined but used in the payload, it must be specified in a rule making use of this contextualzer, e.g. in the following way:\n- id: rule1 # other rule properties execute: - # other mechanisms - contextualizer: foo config: # overriding with rule specifics values: user_id: \u0026#34;{{ .Subject.ID }}\u0026#34; whatever: \u0026#34;some value\u0026#34; - # other mechanisms ","description":"","html_content":"\u003cdiv class=\"paragraph\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContextualizers enrich the information about the \u003ca href=\"/docs/configuration/rules/pipeline_mechanisms/overview/#_subject\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eSubject\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/a\u003e obtained via an authenticator mechanism with further information, required by either the endpoint of the upstream service itself or an authorizer mechanism.

execution of the pipeline and enrich the request with data such as subject information or authentication tokens required by the upstream service. The available options range from adding a simple header over a structured JWT in a specific header, to driving specific protocols, e.g. to obtain a token required by the upstream service.\nFinalizer Types The following sections describe the available finalizer types in more detail. Some of these may support or require additional configuration. The corresponding properties are annotated with mandatory, respectively optional to denote configuration requirement, as well as with overridable, not overriddable and partially overridable to indicate whether the property can be overridden in a rule pipeline.\nNoop As the name implies, this finalizer does nothing. As finalizer are the last step in a rule pipeline and act on the available Subject information, the usage of this finalizer makes only sense in combination with the Noop Authenticator, e.g. if your API should be publicly available. This finalizer type also doesn’t have any configuration options.\nTo enable the usage of this finalizer, you have to set the type property to noop.\nExample 1. Noop finalizer configuration id: foo type: noop Header This finalizer enables transformation of a Subject into HTTP headers. It can also be used to map information from the original Request into headers expected by the upstream service.\nTo enable the usage of this finalizer, you have to set the type property to header.\nConfiguration using the config property is mandatory. Following properties are available:\nheaders: string map (mandatory, overridable)\nEnables configuration of arbitrary headers with any values build from available subject and request information (See also Templating).\nExample 2. Header finalizer configuration id: foo type: header config: headers: X-User-ID: \u0026#39;{{ quote .Subject.ID }}\u0026#39; X-User-Email: \u0026#39;{{ quote .Subject.Attributes[\u0026#34;email\u0026#34;] }}\u0026#39; Host: \u0026#39;{{ quote .Request.Header(\u0026#34;Host\u0026#34;) }}\u0026#39; Cookie This finalizer enables transformation of a Subject into cookies. It can also be used to map information from the original Request into cookies expected by the upstream service.\nTo enable the usage of this finalizer, you have to set the type property to cookie.\nConfiguration using the config property is mandatory. Following properties are available:\ncookies: string map (mandatory, overridable)\nEnables configuration of arbitrary cookies with any values build from available subject information (See also Templating).\nExample 3. Cookie finalizer configuration id: foo type: cookies config: cookies: user_id_cookie: \u0026#39;{{ quote .Subject.ID }}\u0026#39; user_email_cookie: \u0026#39;{{ quote .Subject.Attributes[\u0026#34;email\u0026#34;] }}\u0026#39; JWT This finalizer enables transformation of the Subject object into a token in a JWT format, which is then made available to your upstream service in either the HTTP Authorization header with Bearer scheme set, or in a custom header. In addition to setting the JWT specific claims, it allows setting custom claims as well. Your upstream service can then verify the signature of the JWT by making use of heimdall’s JWKS endpoint to retrieve the required public keys/certificates from.\nTo enable the usage of this finalizer, you have to set the type property to jwt.\nThe usage of this finalizer type requires a configured Signer as well. At least it is a must in production environments. Configuration using the config property is optional. Following properties are available:\nclaims: string (optional, overridable)\nYour template with custom claims, you would like to add to the JWT (See also Templating).\nttl: Duration (optional, overridable)\nDefines how long the JWT should be valid. Defaults to 5 minutes. Heimdall sets the iat and the nbf claims to the current system time. The value of the exp claim is then influenced by the ttl property.\nheader: object (optional, not overridable)\nDefines the name and scheme to be used for the header. Defaults to Authorization with scheme Bearer. If defined, the name property must be set. If scheme is not defined, no scheme will be prepended to the resulting JWT.\nThe generated JWT is always cached until 5 seconds before its expiration. The cache key is calculated from the entire configuration of the finalizer instance and the available information about the current subject.\nExample 4. JWT finalizer configuration id: jwt_finalizer type: jwt config: ttl: 5m header: name: X-Token claims: | { {{ $user_name := .Subject.Attributes.identity.user_name -}} \u0026#34;email\u0026#34;: {{ quote .Subject.Attributes.identity.email }}, \u0026#34;email_verified\u0026#34;: {{ .Subject.Attributes.identity.email_verified }}, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: {{ if $user_name }}{{ quote $user_name }}{{ else }}{{ quote $email }}{{ end }} } OAuth2 Client Credentials This finalizer drives the OAuth2 Client Credentials Grant flow to obtain a token, which should be used for communication with the upstream service. By default, as long as not otherwise configured (see the options below), the obtained token is made available to your upstream service in the HTTP Authorization header with Bearer scheme set. Unlike the other finalizers, it does not have access to any objects created by the rule execution pipeline.\nTo enable the usage of this finalizer, you have to set the type property to oauth2_client_credentials.\nConfiguration using the config property is mandatory. Following properties are available:\ntoken_url: string (mandatory, not overridable)\nThe token endpoint of the authorization server.\nclient_id: string (mandatory, not overridable)\nThe client identifier for heimdall.\nclient_secret: string (mandatory, not overridable)\nThe client secret for heimdall.\nauth_method: string (optional, not overridable)\nThe authentication method to be used according to RFC 6749, Client Password. Can be one of\nbasic_auth (default if auth_method is not set): With that authentication method, the \u0026#34;application/x-www-form-urlencoded\u0026#34; encoded values of client_id and client_secret are sent to the authorization server via the Authorization header using the Basic scheme.\nrequest_body: With that authentication method the client_id and client_secret are sent in the request body together with the other parameters (e.g. scopes) defined by the flow.\nUsage of request_body authentication method is not recommended and should be avoided. scopes: string array (optional, overridable)\nThe scopes required for the access token.\ncache_ttl: Duration (optional, overridable)\nHow long to cache the token received from the token endpoint. Defaults to the token expiration information from the token endpoint (the value of the expires_in field) if present. If the token expiration inforation is not present and cache_ttl is not configured, the received token is not cached. If the token expiration information is present in the response and cache_ttl is configured the shorter value is taken. If caching is enabled, the token is cached until 5 seconds before its expiration. To disable caching, set it to 0s. The cache key calculation is based on the entire oauth2_client_credentials configuration without considering the header property.\nheader: object (optional, overridable)\nDefines the name and scheme to be used for the header. Defaults to Authorization with scheme Bearer. If defined, the name property must be set. If scheme is not defined, no scheme will be prepended to the resulting JWT.\nExample 5.

The error handler mechanisms range from a simple error response to the client which sent the request to sophisticated ones, supporting complex logic and redirects.\nError Handler Types The following sections describe the available error handler types in more detail. Some of these may support or require additional configuration. The corresponding properties are annotated with mandatory, respectively optional to denote configuration requirement, as well as with overridable, not overriddable and partially overridable to indicate whether the property can be overridden in a rule pipeline.\nDefault This mechanism is always there and is executed if no other error handler mechanism is responsible for the error. Actually, there is no need to explicitly configure it. The only exception is to allow overriding the default rule’s error handler chain in a specific rule for performance reasons (if configured error handlers in the default rule should not be considered). This mechanism type doesn’t have any configuration options.\nTo enable the usage of this mechanism, you have to set the type property to default.\nExample 1. Configuring Default error handler to enable referencing it from rules id: foo type: default Redirect This error handler mechanism allows redirecting the client to another endpoint, e.g. to let the user authenticate. Technically this error handler returns e.g. a HTTP 302 Found response code and sets the HTTP Location header.\nTo enable the usage of this mechanism, you have to set the type property to redirect.\nConfiguration using the config property is mandatory. Following properties are available:\nto: URL (mandatory, not overridable)\nThe url to redirect the client to via the Location header. Can be templated and has access to the Request object.\nWhen creating query parameters by making use of templates, don’t forget to encode the values using the urlenc function. See also examples below. code: int (optional, not overridable)\nThe code to be used for the redirect. Defaults to 302 Found.\nHeimdall does not check the configured code for HTTP redirect validity! when: Error Condition array (mandatory, overridable)\nConditions, which must hold true for this error handler to execute. The defined conditions are evaluated using a boolean or. So at least one of the defined conditions must evaluate to true to have this error handler executed.\nExample 2. Redirect error handler configuration The redirect error handler below is configured to kick in if either\nthe first error condition evaluates to true. This condition is for web requests (HTTP Accept header contains text/html) if an authentication_error error occurred (an error raised by authenticators). In this case, it will redirect the client (for web requests, usually a browser) to http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/login/browser and also add the return_to query parameter set to the URL encoded value of the current url.\nOr, if the second condition evaluates to true. The only difference to the previous one is the error type, which is authorization_error in this case.\nSo, e.g. if Heimdall was handling the request for http://my-service.local/foo and run into an error like described above, the value of the HTTP Location header will be set to http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/login/browser?return_to=http%3A%2F%2Fmy-service.local%2Ffoo\nid: authenticate_with_kratos type: redirect config: to: http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/login/browser?return_to={{ .Request.URL | urlenc }} when: - error: - type: authentication_error request_headers: Accept: - text/html - error: - type: authorization_error request_headers: Accept: - text/html In this case the error condition can actually be simplified, so the mechanism configuration can look like this:\nid: authenticate_with_kratos type: redirect config: to: http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/login/browser?return_to={{ .Request.URL | urlenc }} when: - error: - type: authentication_error - type: authorization_error request_headers: Accept: - text/html WWW-Authenticate This error handler mechanism responds with HTTP 401 Unauthorized and a WWW-Authenticate HTTP header set. As of now, this error handler is the only one error handler, which transforms heimdall into an authentication system, a very simple one though ;). By configuring this error handler you can implement the Basic HTTP Authentication Scheme by also making use of the Basic Auth authenticator. Without that authenticator, the usage of this error handler does actually not make any sense.\nTo enable the usage of this error handler, you have to set the type property to www_authenticate.\nConfiguration using the config property is mandatory. Following properties are available:\nrealm: string (optional, overridable)\nThe \u0026#34;realm\u0026#34; according to RFC 7235, section 2.2. Defaults to \u0026#34;Please authenticate\u0026#34;.\nwhen: Error Condition array (mandatory, overridable)\nConditions, which must hold true for this error handler to execute. The defined conditions are evaluated using a boolean or. So at least one of the defined conditions must evaluate to true to have this error handler executed.\nExample 3. Configuration of WWW-Authenticate error handler The www authenticate error handler below is configured to kick in for web requests (HTTP Accept header contains text/html) if an authentication_error error occurred (an error raised by authenticators) and has been raised by an authenticator with id equal to basic_auth_authenticator. In this case, it will respond with HTTP 401 Unauthorized and a WWW-Authenticate header set to Basic realm=\u0026#34;My fancy app\u0026#34;.\nid: basic_authenticate type: www_authenticate config: realm: \u0026#34;My fancy app\u0026#34; when: - error: - type: authentication_error raised_by: basic_auth_authenticator request_headers: Accept: - text/html ","description":"","html_content":"\u003cdiv class=\"paragraph\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eError Handlers are responsible for execution of logic if any of the \u003ca href=\"/docs/configuration/rules/pipeline_mechanisms/authenticators/\"\u003eauthenticators\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"/docs/configuration/rules/pipeline_mechanisms/authorizers/\"\u003eauthorizers\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"/docs/configuration/rules/pipeline_mechanisms/contextualizers/\"\u003econtextualizers\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"/docs/configuration/rules/pipeline_mechanisms/finalizers/\"\u003efinalizers\u003c/a\u003e fails.

These allow execution of arbitrary logic, required by your upstream service. This section describes everything related to the configuration of a particular rule and how can these be combined to rule sets, which can then be loaded by a rule provider.\nRule Configuration A single rule consists of the following properties:\nid: string (mandatory)\nThe unique identifier of a rule. It must be unique across all rules loaded by the same Rule Provider. To ensure this, it is recommended to let the id include the name of your upstream service, as well as its purpose. E.g. rule:my-service:public-api.\nmatch: RuleMatcher (mandatory)\nDefines how to match a rule and supports the following properties:\nurl: string (mandatory)\nGlob or Regex pattern of the endpoints of your upstream service, which this rule should apply to. Query parameters are ignored.\nstrategy: string (optional)\nWhich strategy to use for matching of the value, provided in the url property. Can be one of:\nregex - to match url expressions by making use of regular expressions. Internally, heimdall makes use of Heimdall uses dlclark/regexp2 to implement this strategy. Head over to linked resource to get more insights about possible options.\nExample 1. Regular expressions patterns https://mydomain.com/ matches https://mydomain.com/ and doesn’t match https://mydomain.com/foo or https://mydomain.com.\n\u0026lt;https|http\u0026gt;://mydomain.com/\u0026lt;.*\u0026gt; matches https://mydomain.com/ and http://mydomain.com/foo. Doesn’t match https://other-domain.com/ or https://mydomain.com.\nhttp://mydomain.com/\u0026lt;+\u0026gt; matches http://mydomain.com/123, but doesn’t match http://mydomain/abc.\nhttp://mydomain.com/\u0026lt;(?!protected).*\u0026gt; matches http://mydomain.com/resource, but doesn’t match http://mydomain.com/protected.\nglob - to match url expressions by making use of glob expressions. Internally, heimdall makes use of Heimdall uses gobwas/glob to implement this strategy. Head over to linked resource to get more insights about possible options.\nExample 2. Glob patterns https://mydomain.com/\u0026lt;m?n\u0026gt; matches https://mydomain.com/man and does not match http://mydomain.com/foo.\nhttps://mydomain.com/\u0026lt;{foo*,bar*}\u0026gt; matches https://mydomain.com/foo or https://mydomain.com/bar and doesn’t match https://mydomain.com/any.\nmethods: string array (optional)\nWhich HTTP methods (GET, POST, PATCH, etc) are allowed for the matched URL. If not specified, every request to that URL will result in 405 Method Not Allowed response from heimdall. If all methods should be allowed, one can use a special ALL placeholder. If all, except some specific methods should be allowed, one can specify ALL and remove specific methods by adding the ! sign to the to be removed method. In that case you have to specify the value in braces. See also examples below.\nExample 3. Methods list which effectively expands to all HTTP methods methods: - ALL Example 4. Methods list consisting of all HTTP methods without TRACE and OPTIONS methods: - ALL - \u0026#34;!TRACE\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;!OPTIONS\u0026#34; forward_to: RequestForwarder (mandatory in Proxy operation mode)\nDefines where to forward the proxied request to. Used only when heimdall is operated in the Proxy operation mode and supports the following properties:\nhost: string (mandatory)\nHost (and port) to be used for request forwarding. If no rewrite property (see below) is specified, all other parts, like scheme, path, etc. of the original url are preserved. E.g. if the original request is https://mydomain.com/api/v1/something?foo=bar\u0026amp;bar=baz and the value of this property is set to my-backend:8080, the url used to forward the request to the upstream will be https://my-backend:8080/api/v1/something?foo=bar\u0026amp;bar=baz\nThe Host header is not preserved while forwarding the request. If you need it to be set to the value from the original request, make use of the header finalizer in your execute pipeline and set it accordingly. The example below demonstrates that. rewrite: OriginalURLRewriter (optional)\nCan be used to rewrite further parts of the original url before forwarding the request. If specified at least one of the following supported (middleware) properties must be specified:\nscheme: string (optional)\nIf defined, heimdall will use the specified value for the url scheme part while forwarding the request to the upstream.\nstrip_path_prefix: string (optional)\nIf defined, heimdall will strip the specified prefix from the original url path. E.g. if the path of the original url is /api/v1/something and the value of this property is set to /api/v1, the request to the upstream will have the url path set to /something.\nadd_path_prefix: string (optional)\nThis middleware is applied after the execution of the strip_path_prefix middleware described above. If defined, heimdall will add the specified path prefix to the path used to forward the request to the upstream service. E.g. if the path of the original url or the pass resulting after the application of the strip_path_prefix middleware is /something and the value of this property is set to /my-backend, the request to the upstream will have the url path set to /my-backend/something.\nstrip_query_parameters: string array (optional)\nIf defined, heimdall will remove the specified query parameters from the original url before forwarding the request to the upstream service. E.g. if the query parameters part of the original url is foo=bar\u0026amp;bar=baz and the value of this property is set to [\u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;], the query part of the request to the upstream will be set to bar=baz\nexecute: Regular Pipeline (mandatory)\nWhich mechanisms to use to authenticate, authorize, contextualize (enrich) and finalize the pipeline.\non_error: Error Handler Pipeline (optional)\nWhich error handler mechanisms to use if any of the mechanisms, defined in the execute property, fails. This property is optional only, if a default rule has been configured and contains an on_error definition.\nExample 5. An example rule id: rule:foo:bar match: url: http://my-service.local/\u0026lt;**\u0026gt; strategy: glob forward_to: host: backend-a:8080 rewrite: scheme: http strip_path_prefix: /api/v1 methods: - GET - POST execute: # the following just demonstrates how to make use of specific # mechanisms in the simplest possible form - authenticator: foo - authorizer: bar - contextualizer: foo - finalizer: zab # the following one demonstrates how to preserve the # Host header from the original request, while forwarding # it to the upstream service - finalizer: preserve-host # the config property can be omitted, if already configured # in the header finalizer mechanism config: headers: Host: \u0026#39;{{ .Request.Header(\u0026#34;Host\u0026#34;) }}\u0026#39; on_error: - error_handler: foobar Regular Pipeline As described in the Concepts section, heimdall’s decision pipeline consists of multiple mechanisms - at least consisting of authenticators. The definition of such a pipeline happens as a list of required mechanisms (previously configured) with the corresponding IDs in the following order:\nList of authenticators using authenticator as key, followed by the required authenticator id. Authenticators following the first defined in the list are used by heimdall as fallback. That is, if first authenticator fails due to missing authentication data, second is executed, etc. By default, fallback is not used if an authenticator fails due to validation errors of the given authentication data. E.g. if an authenticator fails to validate the signature of a JWT token, the next authenticator in the list will not be executed. Instead, the entire pipeline will fail and lead to the execution of the error handler pipeline. This list is mandatory if no default rule is configured.\nSome authenticators use the same sources to get subject authentication object from. E.g. the jwt and the oauth2_introspection authenticators can retrieve tokens from the same places in the request. If such authenticators are used in the same pipeline, you should configure the more specific ones before the more general ones to have working default fallbacks. To stay with the above example, the jwt authenticator is more specific compared to oauth2_introspection, as it will be only executed, if the token is in a JWT format. In contrast to this, the oauth2_introspection authenticator is more general and does not care about the token format, thus will feel responsible for the request as soon as it finds a bearer token. You can however also make use of the allow_fallback_on_error configuration property and set it to true. This will allow a fallback even if the verification of the credentials fail. List of contextualizers and authorizers in any order (optional). Can also be mixed. As with authenticators, the list definition happens using either contextualizer or authorizer as key, followed by the required id. All mechanisms in this list are executed in the order, they are defined. If any of these fails, the entire pipeline fails, which leads to the execution of the error handler pipeline. This list is optional.\nList of finalizers using finalizers as key, followed by the required finalizer id. All finalizers in this list are executed in the order they are defined. If any of these fail, the entire pipeline fails, which leads to the execution of the error handler pipeline. This list is optional. If a default rule is configured, and no finalizers are configured on a specific rule level, the finalizers from the default rule are used. If the default rule does not have any finalizers configured either, no finalization will take place.\nIn all cases, the used mechanism can be partially reconfigured if supported by the corresponding type. Configuration goes into the config properties. These reconfigurations are always local to the given rule. With other words, you can adjust your rule specific pipeline as you want without any side effects.\nExecution of an contextualizer, authorizer, or finalizer mechanisms can optionally happen conditionally by making use of a CEL expression in an if clause, which has access to the Subject and the Request objects. If the if clause is not present, the corresponding mechanism is always executed.\nExample 6. Complex pipeline # list of authenticators - authenticator: foo - authenticator: bar config: subject: anon # ... any further required authenticator # list of authorizers and contextualizers in any order - contextualizer: baz config: cache_ttl: 0s - authorizer: zab - contextualizer: foo if: Subject.ID != \u0026#34;anonymous\u0026#34; - contextualizer: bar - authorizer: foo if: Request.Method == \u0026#34;POST\u0026#34; config: expressions: - expression: | // some expression logic deviating from the // definition in the pipeline configuration. # ... any further required authorizer or contextualizer # list of finalizers - finalizer: foo - finalizer: bar config: headers: - X-User-ID: {{ quote .ID }} # ... any further required finalizers This example uses\ntwo authenticators, with authenticator named bar being the fallback for the authenticator named foo. This fallback authenticator is obviously of type anonymous as it reconfigures the referenced prototype to use anon for subject id.\nmultiple contextualizers and authorizers, with first contextualizer having its cache disabled (cache_ttl set to 0s) and the last authorizer being of type cel as it reconfigures the referenced prototype to use a different authorization script.\ntwo finalizers, with the second one being obviously of type header, as it defines a X-User-ID header set to the value of the subject id to be forwarded to the upstream service.\ncontextualizer foo is only executed if the authenticated subject is not anonymous.\nauthorizer foo is only executed if the request method is HTTP POST.\nError Handler Pipeline Compared to the Regular Pipeline, the error handler pipeline is pretty simple. It is also a list of mechanisms, but all referenced types are error handler types. Thus, each entry in this list must have error_handler as key, followed by the ìd of the required error handler, previously defined in Heimdall’s Pipeline Mechanisms configuration. Error handlers are always executed as fallbacks. So, if the condition of the first error handler does not match, second is selected, if its condition matches, it is executed, otherwise the next one is selected, etc. If none of the conditions of the defined error handlers match, the default error handler is executed.\nAs with the regular pipeline, partial reconfiguration of the used mechanisms is possible if supported by the corresponding type. The overrides are always local to the given rule as well.\nExample 7. Two error handlers - error_handler: foo - error_handler: bar config: when: # rule specific conditions This example uses two error handlers, named foo and bar. bar will only be selected by heimdall if foo \u0026#39;s error condition (defined in Heimdall’s Pipeline Mechanisms configuration) does not match. bar does also override the error condition as required by the given rule.\nRule Set In principle, a rule set is just a list of rules with some additional meta information. Each RuleSet definition has the following attributes if not stated otherwise by a particular provider:\nversion: string (mandatory)\nThe version schema of the RuleSet. The current version of heimdall supports only the version 1.\nname: string (optional)\nThe name of a rule set. Used only for logging purposes.\nrules: Rule Configuration array (mandatory)\nList of the actual rules.\nExample 8.

href=\"/docs/getting_started/concepts/\"\u003eConcepts\u003c/a\u003e section, heimdall’s decision pipeline consists of multiple mechanisms - at least consisting of \u003ca href=\"/docs/configuration/rules/pipeline_mechanisms/authenticators/\"\u003eauthenticators\u003c/a\u003e. The definition of such a pipeline happens as a list of required mechanisms (previously \u003ca href=\"/docs/configuration/rules/pipeline_mechanisms/overview/\"\u003econfigured\u003c/a\u003e) with the corresponding IDs in the following order:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"ulist\"\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eList of \u003ca href=\"/docs/configuration/rules/pipeline_mechanisms/authenticators/\"\u003eauthenticators\u003c/a\u003e using \u003ccode\u003eauthenticator\u003c/code\u003e as key, followed by the required authenticator \u003ccode\u003eid\u003c/code\u003e. Authenticators following the first defined in the list are used by heimdall as fallback. That is, if first authenticator fails due to missing authentication data, second is executed, etc. By default, fallback is not used if an authenticator fails due to validation errors of the given authentication data. E.g. if an authenticator fails to validate the signature of a JWT token, the next authenticator in the list will not be executed. Instead, the entire pipeline will fail and lead to the execution of the \u003ca href=\"#_error_handler_pipeline\"\u003eerror handler pipeline\u003c/a\u003e. This list is mandatory if no \u003ca href=\"/docs/configuration/rules/default/\"\u003edefault rule\u003c/a\u003e is configured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"admonitionblock note\"\u003e\n\u003ctable\u003e\n\u003ctbody\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\n\u003ctd class=\"icon\"\u003e\n\u003ci class=\"fa icon-note\" title=\"Note\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\n\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd class=\"content\"\u003e\nSome authenticators use the same sources to get subject authentication object from. E.g. the \u003ccode\u003ejwt\u003c/code\u003e and the \u003ccode\u003eoauth2_introspection\u003c/code\u003e authenticators can retrieve tokens from the same places in the request. If such authenticators are used in the same pipeline, you should configure the more specific ones before the more general ones to have working default fallbacks. To stay with the above example, the \u003ccode\u003ejwt\u003c/code\u003e authenticator is more specific compared to \u003ccode\u003eoauth2_introspection\u003c/code\u003e, as it will be only executed, if the token is in a JWT format. In contrast to this, the \u003ccode\u003eoauth2_introspection\u003c/code\u003e authenticator is more general and does not care about the token format, thus will feel responsible for the request as soon as it finds a bearer token. You can however also make use of the \u003ccode\u003eallow_fallback_on_error\u003c/code\u003e configuration property and set it to \u003ccode\u003etrue\u003c/code\u003e. This will allow a fallback even if the verification of the credentials fail.\n\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003c/tbody\u003e\u003c/table\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eList of \u003ca href=\"(/docs/configuration/rules/pipeline_mechanisms/contextualizers/\"\u003econtextualizers\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"(/docs/configuration/rules/pipeline_mechanisms/authorizers/\"\u003eauthorizers\u003c/a\u003e in any order (optional).

This way you can ensure secure defaults by simultaneously reducing the amount of work while defining upstream service API specific rules. That is, an upstream service API specific rule can reuse definitions from the default rule.\nThe default rule does not support all the properties, which can be configured in a specific rule. E.g. it can not be used to forward requests to an upstream service, heimdall is protecting. So, if you operate heimdall in the reverse proxy mode, the default rule should be configured to reject requests. Otherwise, heimdall will respond with an error. The configuration of the default rule can be done by making use of the default_rule property and configuring the following options.\nmethods: string array (optional)\nWhich HTTP methods (GET, POST, PATCH, etc) are allowed. Expansion using ALL and removal by prefixing the method with an ! is supported as with the regular rules. Defaults to an empty array. If the default rule is defined and the upstream service API specific rule (see also Rule Definition does not override it, no methods will be accepted, effectively resulting in 405 Method Not Allowed response to Heimdall’s client for any urls matched by that particular rule.\nexecute: Regular Pipeline (mandatory)\nWhich mechanisms to use for authentication, authorization, contextualization (enrich) and finalization of the pipeline. At least one authenticator must be defined. A specific rule (see also Rule) can omit the definition of authenticators, if it wants to reuse the authenticators defined in the default rule. Same is true for other mechanisms. Exception are authorizers and contextualizers. As soon, as a specific rule defines at least one authorizer or contextualizer, those authorizers and contextualizers (defined in the default rule) are not considered anymore.\non_error: Error Handler Pipeline (mandatory)\nWhich error handler mechanisms to use if any of the mechanisms, defined in the execute property fail. Allows omitting the definition of error handlers in specific rules. As soon as a specific rule defines at least one error handler mechanism, all error handler mechanisms, defined in the default rule are ignored.\nExample 1. Default rule configuration default_rule: methods: - GET - PATCH execute: - authenticator: session_cookie_from_kratos_authn - authenticator: oauth2_introspect_token_from_keycloak_authn - authorizer: deny_all_requests_authz - finalizer: create_jwt on_error: - error_handler: authenticate_with_kratos_eh This example defines a default rule, which allows HTTP GET and PATCH requests on any URL (will respond with 405 Method Not Allowed for any other HTTP method used by a client). The regular pipeline consists of two authenticators, with session_cookie_from_kratos_authn being the first and oauth2_introspect_token_from_keycloak_authn being the fallback (if the first one fails), a deny_all_requests_authz authorizer and the create_jwt finalizer. The error pipeline is configured to execute only the authenticate_with_kratos_eh error handler.\nObviously, the regular pipeline (defined in the execute property) of this default rule will always result in an error due to deny_all_requests_authz. This way it is thought to provide secure defaults and let the upstream specific rules override at least the part dealing with authorization. Such an upstream specific rule could then look like follows:\nid: rule:my-service:protected-api match: url: http://my-service.local/foo execute: - authorizer: allow_all_requests_authz Take a look at how methods, on_error, as well as the authenticators and finalizers from the execute definition of the default rule are reused.

These make heimdall’s behavior dynamic. All providers, you want to enable for a heimdall instance must be configured within the providers section of heimdall’s configuration.\nSupported providers, including the corresponding configuration options are described below\nFilesystem The filesystem provider allows loading of rule sets in a format defined in Rule Sets from a file system. The configuration of this provider goes into the file_system property. This provider is handy for e.g. starting playing around with heimdall, e.g. locally, or using a container runtime, as well as if your deployment strategy considers deploying a heimdall instance as a Side-Car for each of your services.\nFollowing configuration options are supported:\nsrc: string (mandatory)\nCan either be a single file, containing a rule set, or a directory with files, each containing a rule set.\nwatch: boolean (optional)\nWhether the configured src should be watched for updates. Defaults to false. If the src has been configured to a single file, the provider will watch for changes in that file. Otherwise, if the src has been configured to a directory, the provider will watch for files appearing and disappearing in this directory, as well as for changes in each particular file in this directory. Recursive lookup is not supported. That is, if the configured directory contains further directories, these, as well as their contents are ignored.\nenv_vars_enabled: boolean (optional)\nWhether to enable environment variables access in the rule set files. Defaults to false. If set to true, environment variables usage using Bash syntax is possible as with the static configuration.\nAll environment variables, used in the rule set files must be known in advance to the heimdall process (when it starts). In addition, the usage of that functionality might lead to security issues. If an adversary is somehow able to add new or update existing rule sets, it would be theoretically able exfiltrating environment variables available to the heimdall process by crafting contextualizers or authorizers, which would forward the corresponding values to a controlled service. So, use with caution, disable the watching of rule set updates and try to avoid! Example 1. Rule set which makes use of environment variables version: \u0026#34;1alpha3\u0026#34; name: my-rule-set rules: - id: rule:1 match: url: https://my-service1.local/\u0026lt;**\u0026gt; forward_to: host: ${UPSTREAM_HOST:=\u0026#34;default-backend:8080\u0026#34;} methods: [ \u0026#34;GET\u0026#34; ] execute: - authorizer: foobar Example 2. Load rule sets from the files residing in the /path/to/rules/dir directory and watch for changes. file_system: src: /path/to/rules/dir watch: true Example 3. Load rule sets from the /path/to/rules.yaml file without watching it for changes. file_system: src: /path/to/rules.yaml HTTP Endpoint This provider allows loading of rule sets in a format defined in Rule Sets from any remote endpoint accessible via HTTP(s) and supports rule sets in YAML, as well as in JSON format. The differentiation happens based on the Content-Type set in the response from the endpoint, which must be either application/yaml or application/json, otherwise an error is logged and the response from the endpoint is ignored.\nThe loading and removal of rules happens as follows:\nif the response status code is an HTTP 200 OK and contains a Rule Sets in a known format (see above), the corresponding rules are loaded (if the definitions are valid)\nin case of network issues, like dns errors, timeouts and alike, the rule sets previously received from the corresponding endpoints are preserved.\nin any other case related to network communication (e.g. not 200 status code, empty response body, unsupported format, network issues, etc.), the corresponding rules are removed if these were previously loaded.\nThe configuration of this provider goes into the http_endpoint property. In contrast to the Filesystem provider it can be configured with as many endpoints to load rule sets from as required for the particular use case.\nFollowing configuration options are supported:\nwatch_interval: Duration (optional)\nWhether the configured endpoints should be polled for updates. Defaults to 0s (polling disabled).\nendpoints: RuleSetEndpoint array (mandatory)\nEach entry of that array supports all the properties defined by Endpoint, except method, which is always GET. enable_http_cacheAs with the Endpoint type, at least the url must be configured. Following properties are defined in addition:\nrule_path_match_prefix: string (optional)\nThis property can be used to create kind of a namespace for the rule sets retrieved from the different endpoints. If set, the provider checks whether the urls specified in all rules retrieved from the referenced endpoint have the defined path prefix. If not, a warning is emitted and the rule set is ignored. This can be used to ensure a rule retrieved from one endpoint does not collide with a rule from another endpoint.\nHTTP caching according to RFC 7234 is enabled by default. It can be disabled by setting enable_http_cache to false. Example 4. Minimal possible configuration Here the provider is configured to load a rule set from one endpoint without polling it for changes.\nhttp_endpoint: endpoints: - url: http://foo.bar/ruleset1 Example 5. Load rule sets from remote endpoints and watch for changes. Here, the provider is configured to poll the two defined rule set endpoints for changes every 5 minutes.\nThe configuration for the first endpoint instructs heimdall to ensure all urls defined in the rules coming from that endpoint must match the defined path prefix.\nThe configuration for the second endpoint defines the rule_path_match_prefix as well. It also defines a couple of other properties. One to ensure the communication to that endpoint is more resilient by setting the retry options and since this endpoint is protected by an API key, it defines the corresponding options as well.\nhttp_endpoint: watch_interval: 5m endpoints: - url: http://foo.bar/ruleset1 rule_path_match_prefix: /foo/bar - url: http://foo.bar/ruleset2 rule_path_match_prefix: /bar/foo retry: give_up_after: 5s max_delay: 250ms auth: type: api_key config: name: X-Api-Key value: super-secret in: header Cloud Blob This provider allows loading of rule sets in a format defined in Rule Sets from cloud blobs, like AWS S3 buckets, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blobs, or other API compatible implementations and supports rule sets in YAML, as well as in JSON format. The differentiation happens based on the Content-Type set in the metadata of the loaded blob, which must be either application/yaml or application/json, otherwise an error is logged and the blob is ignored.\nThe loading and removal of rules happens as follows:\nif the response status code is an HTTP 200 OK and contains a rule set in a known format (see above), the corresponding rules are loaded (if the definitions are valid)\nin case of network issues, like dns errors, timeouts and alike, the rule sets previously received from the corresponding buckets are preserved.\nin any other case related to network communication (like, not 200 status code, empty response body, unsupported format, etc.), the corresponding rules are removed if these were previously loaded.\nThe configuration of this provider goes into the cloud_blob property. As with HTTP Endpoint provider, it can be configured with as many buckets/blobs to load rule sets from as required for the particular use case.\nFollowing configuration options are supported:\nwatch_interval: Duration (optional)\nWhether the configured buckets should be polled for updates. Defaults to 0s (polling disabled).\nbuckets: BlobReference array (mandatory)\nEach BlobReference entry in that array supports the following properties:\nurl: string (mandatory)\nThe actual url to the bucket or to a specific blob in the bucket.\nprefix: string (optional)\nIndicates that only blobs with a key starting with this prefix should be retrieved\nrule_path_match_prefix: string (optional)\nCreates kind of a namespace for the rule sets retrieved from the blobs. If set, the provider checks whether the urls patterns specified in all rules retrieved from the referenced bucket have the defined path prefix. If that rule is violated, a warning is emitted and the rule set is ignored. This can be used to ensure a rule retrieved from one endpoint does not override a rule from another endpoint.\nThe differentiation which storage is used is based on the URL scheme. These are:\ns3 for AWS S3 buckets\ngs for Google Cloud Storage and\nazblob for Azure Blob Storage\nOther API compatible storage services, like Minio, Ceph, SeaweedFS, etc. can be used as well. The corresponding and other options can be found in the Go CDK Blob documentation, the implementation of this provider is based on.\nThe communication to the storage services requires an active session to the corresponding cloud provider. The session information is taken from the vendor specific environment variables, respectively configuration. See AWS Session, GC Application Default Credentials and Azure Storage Access for more information. Example 6. Minimal possible configuration Here the provider is configured to load rule sets from all blobs stored on the Google Cloud Storage bucket named \u0026#34;my-bucket\u0026#34; without polling for changes.\ncloud_blob: buckets: - url: gs://my-bucket Example 7. Load rule sets from AWS S3 buckets and watch for changes. cloud_blob: watch_interval: 2m buckets: - url: gs://my-bucket prefix: service1 rule_path_match_prefix: /service1 - url: gs://my-bucket prefix: service2 rule_path_match_prefix: /service2 - url: s3://my-bucket/my-rule-set?region=us-west-1 Here, the provider is configured to poll multiple buckets with rule sets for changes every 2 minutes.\nThe first two bucket reference configurations reference actually the same bucket on Google Cloud Storage, but different blobs based on the configured blob prefix. The first one will let heimdall loading only those blobs, which start with service1, the second only those, which start with service2. As rule_path_match_prefix are defined for both as well, heimdall will ensure, that rule sets loaded from the corresponding blobs will not overlap in their url matching definitions.\nThe last one instructs heimdall to load rule set from a specific blob, namely a blob named my-rule-set, which resides on the my-bucket AWS S3 bucket, which is located in the us-west-1 AWS region.\nKubernetes This provider is only supported if heimdall is running within Kubernetes and allows usage (validation and loading) of Rule Set resources deployed to the same Kubernetes environment. The configuration of this provider goes into the kubernetes property and supports the following configuration options:\nauth_class: string (optional)\nBy making use of this property, you can specify which RuleSets should be used by this particular heimdall instance. If specified, heimdall will consider the value of the authClassName attribute of each RuleSet deployed to the cluster and validate, respectively load only those rules, which authClassName values match the value of auth_class. If not set all RuleSets will be used.\ntls: TLS (optional)\nIf configured, heimdall will start and expose a validating admission controller service on port 4458 listening on all interfaces. This service allows integration with the Kubernetes API server enabling validation of the applied RuleSet resources before these are made available to heimdall for loading. This way you will get a direct feedback about RuleSet issues without the need to look into heimdall logs if a RuleSet could not be loaded (See also API documentation for more details).\nTo let the Kubernetes API server use the admission controller, there is a need for a properly configured ValidatingWebhookConfiguration. The Helm Chart shipped with heimdall does this automatically as soon as this property is configured. It does however need a caBundle to be set or injected. Otherwise, the Kubernetes API server won’t trust the configured TLS certificate and won’t use the endpoint.\nSince multiple heimdall deployments with different configured auth_class names can coexist, RuleSets with mismatching authClassName will be ignored by a particular deployment. In addition, Kubernetes API server validation requests for mismatching RuleSets result in a successful response. This behavior is required as otherwise, as soon as the API server receives even a single failed validation response, the affected RuleSet resource will be discarded and not made available for loading to any of the available heimdall deployments.\nThat also means, if there is no heimdall deployment feeling responsible for the given RuleSet (due to authClassName - auth_class mismatch), the affected RuleSet will be silently ignored.\nExample 8. Minimal possible configuration Here, the provider is just enabled. Since no auth_class is configured, it will load all RuleSets deployed to the Kubernetes environment.\nkubernetes: {} Example 9. Configuration with auth_class set Here, the provider is configured to consider only those RuleSets, which authClassName is set to foo.\nkubernetes: auth_class: foo Example 10. Configuration with auth_class set and enabled validating admission controller As with the previous example, the provider is configured to consider only those RuleSets, which authClassName is set to foo. The admission controller is enabled as well and will validate RuleSet resources before these are made available for loading.\nkubernetes: auth_class: foo tls: # below is the minimal required configuration key_store: path: /path/to/file.pem This provider requires a RuleSet CRD being deployed, otherwise heimdall will not be able to monitor corresponding resources and emit error messages to the log.\nIf you have used the Helm Chart to install heimdall, this CRD is already installed. You can however install it also like this:\n$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dadrus/heimdall/main/charts/heimdall/crds/ruleset.yaml RuleSet resource As written above, the kubernetes provider supports only rules, deployed as customer RuleSet resources.\nEach RuleSet has the following attributes:\nname: string (required)\nThe name of a rule set.\nauthClassName: string (optional)\nReferences the heimdall instance, which should use this RuleSet.\nrules: Rule Configuration array (mandatory)\nList of the actual rules.\nExample 11. Simple Example apiVersion: heimdall.dadrus.github.com/v1alpha3 kind: RuleSet metadata: name: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;some name\u0026gt;\u0026#34; spec: authClassName: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;optional auth_class reference (see above)\u0026gt; \u0026#34; rules: - id: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;identifier of a rule 1\u0026gt;\u0026#34; match: url: http://127.0.0.1:9090/foo/\u0026lt;**\u0026gt; execute: - authenticator: foo - authorizer: bar In addition to configuration attributes described above, a RuleSet resource has a status stanza, which provides information about the usage status as soon as a RuleSet has been loaded by at least one heimdall instance.\nBy making use of kubectl get -n \u0026lt;your namespace\u0026gt; rulesets.heimdall.dadrus.github.com you’ll get an overview of deployed RuleSet resources in a particular namespace, like e.g. shown below\nNAME ACTIVE IN AGE test-rules 2/2 32m The value 2/2 in ACTIVE IN means, \u0026lt;active in heimdall instances\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;matching instances\u0026gt;. With\n\u0026#34;matching instances\u0026#34; being those heimdall instances, which auth_class matches the authClassName in the RuleSet and\n\u0026#34;active in heimdall instances\u0026#34; are those from the \u0026#34;matching instances\u0026#34;, which were able to load the RuleSet.\nIn addition, you can also get further information about the executed reconciliations by the deployed heimdall instances by taking a look at the .status.conditions field. The reconciliation status of matching instances is present there. That also means, if there were errors while loading the RuleSet, these are present in this condition list\nE.g.\n$ kubectl describe -n test rulesets.heimdall.dadrus.github.com test-rules Name: test-rules Namespace: test ...

Defaults to 10 seconds.\nExample 1. Assertions configuration issuers: - foo - bar audience: - zap scopes: - baz allowed_algorithms: - ES512 validity_leeway: 5s Here we say, the token must have been issued either by the issuer foo, or the issuer bar, the aud claim must contain zap, the scope claim (either scp or scope) must be present and contain the scope baz, if the token or the introspection response is signed, it must have been signed by using the ES512 algorithm (ECDSA using P-521 and SHA-512) and if the information about token validity is present, we respect a deviation of 5 seconds.\nAuthentication Data Source An authentication data source is actually a list of possible strategies for subject authentication data retrieval. The entries following the first one are fallbacks and are only executed if the previous strategy could not retrieve the required authentication data from the request.\nThis fallback mechanism can become handy, if different clients of your application send the authentication data using different methods. RFC 6750 describes for example how to use bearer tokens in HTTP requests to access OAuth 2.0 protected resources. This RFC says, a token can either be sent in the Authorization header, or in a query parameter, or even as part of the HTTP body. So you can define the following list to let Heimdall try to extract the access token from all three places:\n- header: Authorization scheme: Bearer - query_parameter: access_token - body_parameter: access_token The available strategies are described in the following sections.\nCookie Strategy This strategy can retrieve authentication data from a specific HTTP cookie. Following properties are supported:\ncookie: string (mandatory)\nThe name of the cookie to use.\nExample 2. Cookie Strategy usage Imagine you want Heimdall to verify an authentication session, which is represented by a specific cookie before the request hits your upstream service. If the client of your upstream application, which is case of a cookie would usually be a browser sends a cookie named \u0026#34;session\u0026#34;, you can inform Heimdall to extract and use it by configuring this strategy as follows:\n- cookie: my_session_cookie Header Strategy This strategy can retrieve authentication data from a specific HTTP header. Following properties are supported:\nheader: string (mandatory)\nThe name of the header to use.\nscheme: string (optional)\nScheme, which should be present in the header value. If specified, but not present in the header value, the authentication data cannot be retrieved, effectively making the affected authenticator feel not responsible for the request.\nExample 3. Header Strategy usage Imagine you want Heimdall to verify an access token used to protect your upstream service. If the client of your upstream application sends the access token in the HTTP Authorization header, you can inform Heimdall to extract it from there by configuring this strategy as follows:\n- header: Authorization scheme: Bearer Query Parameter Strategy query_parameter: string (mandatory)\nThe name of the query parameter to use.\nExample 4. Query Parameter Strategy usage Imagine you want Heimdall to verify an access token used to protect your upstream service. If the client of your upstream application sends the access token in the query parameter named \u0026#34;access_token\u0026#34;, you can inform Heimdall to extract it from there by configuring this strategy as follows:\n- query_parameter: access_token Body Parameter Strategy The usage of this strategy is only possible when the request payload is either JSON or application/x-www-form-urlencoded encoded. The Content-Type of the request must also either be set to application/x-www-form-urlencoded or to a MIME type, which contains json.\nbody_parameter: string (mandatory)\nThe name of the body parameter to use.\nExample 5. Body Parameter Strategy usage Imagine you want Heimdall to verify an access token used to protect your upstream service. If the client of your upstream application sends the access token in the body parameter named \u0026#34;access_token\u0026#34;, you can inform Heimdall to extract it from there by configuring this strategy as follows:\n- body_parameter: access_token Authentication Data Forward Strategy Authentication data strategy defines the way how heimdall should forward the authentication data extracted from the request to the used identity management system.\nAn Authentication Data Forward Strategy configuration entry must contain the following two properties:\ntype - The type of the strategy. Available types are described in the following sections.\nconfig - The strategy specific configuration.\nBody Forward Strategy This strategy can be used to embed the extracted authentication data into a body parameter of the request to the identity management system.\ntype must be set to body. config supports the following properties:\nname: string (mandatory)\nThe name of the property for the authentication data.\nExample 6. Body strategy configuration The following snippet shows how to configure this strategy to send e.g. a token in a property named \u0026#34;idToken\u0026#34;.\ntype: body config: name: idToken Depending on the configured \u0026#34;Content-Type\u0026#34; header for the request (see Endpoint headers) the result might look like\nidToken=\u0026lt;whatever the token value is\u0026gt; if the \u0026#34;Content-Type\u0026#34; header was set to application/x-www-form-urlencoded, or\n{ \u0026#34;idToken\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;whatever the token value is\u0026gt;\u0026#34; } otherwise\nCookie Forward Strategy This strategy can be used to embed the extracted authentication data into a cookie of the request to the identity management system.\ntype must be set to cookie. config supports the following properties:\nname: string (mandatory)\nThe name of the cookie for the authentication data.\nExample 7. Cookie strategy configuration The following snippet shows how to configure this strategy to send e.g. a token in a cookie named \u0026#34;it_token\u0026#34;.\ntype: cookie config: name: it_token Header Forward Strategy This strategy can be used to embed the extracted authentication data into a header of the request to the identity management system.\ntype must be set to header. config supports the following properties:\nname: string (mandatory)\nThe name of the header for the authentication data.\nscheme: string (optional)\nThe scheme for the header added in front of the authentication data value.\nExample 8. Header strategy configuration The following snippet shows how to configure this strategy to send e.g. a token in a header named \u0026#34;X-ID-Token\u0026#34; with scheme \u0026#34;Bearer\u0026#34;.\ntype: header config: name: X-ID-Token scheme: Bearer Query Forward Strategy This strategy can be used to embed the extracted authentication data into a query parameter of the request to the identity management system.\nUsing this strategy is discouraged, as it will expose the authentication data to access logs, metrics and tracing. type must be set to query. config supports the following properties:\nname: string (mandatory)\nThe name of the query parameter for the authentication data.\nExample 9. Query strategy configuration The following snippet shows how to configure this strategy to send e.g. a token in a query named \u0026#34;token\u0026#34;.\ntype: query config: name: token Authentication Strategy Authentication strategy is kind of abstract type, so you have to define which specific type to use. Each type has its own configuration options.\nAn AuthStrategy configuration entry must contain the following two properties:\ntype - The type of the strategy. Available types are described in the following sections.\nconfig - The strategy specific configuration.\nAvailable strategies are described in the following sections.\nAPI Key Strategy This strategy can be used if your endpoint expects a specific api key be sent in a header, a cookie or query.\ntype must be set to api_key. config supports the following properties:\nin: string (mandatory)\nWhere to put the api key. Can be either header, cookie, or query.\nUsing query strategy will expose the api key to access logs and tracing. name: string (mandatory)\nThe name of either the header or the cookie.\nvalue: string (mandatory)\nThe value of the api key.\nExample 10. API Key Strategy configuration The following snippet shows how to configure this strategy to send an api key in the X-My-API-Key HTTP header.\ntype: api_key config: in: header name: X-My-API-Key value: super-duper-secret-key Basic Auth Strategy This strategy can be used if your endpoint is protected by HTTP basic authentication and expects the HTTP Authorization header with required values.\ntype must be set to basic_auth. config supports the following properties:\nuser: string (mandatory)\nThe user-id.\npassword: string (mandatory)\nThe password.\nExample 11. Basic Auth Strategy configuration The following snippet shows how to configure this strategy with user set to \u0026#34;Alladin\u0026#34; and password set to \u0026#34;open sesame\u0026#34;\ntype: basic_auth config: user: Alladin password: open sesame OAuth2 Client Credentials Grant Flow Strategy This strategy implements the OAuth2 Client Credentials Grant Flow to obtain an access token expected by the endpoint. Heimdall caches the received access token.\ntype must be set to oauth2_client_credentials. config supports the following properties:\ntoken_url: string (mandatory)\nThe token endpoint of the authorization server.\nclient_id: string (mandatory)\nThe client identifier for heimdall.\nclient_secret: string (mandatory)\nThe client secret for heimdall.\nauth_method: string (optional)\nThe authentication method to be used according to RFC 6749, Client Password. Can be one of\nbasic_auth (default if auth_method is not set): With that authentication method, the \u0026#34;application/x-www-form-urlencoded\u0026#34; encoded values of client_id and client_secret are sent to the authorization server via the Authorization header using the Basic scheme.\nrequest_body: With that authentication method the client_id and client_secret are sent in the request body together with the other parameters (e.g. scopes) defined by the flow.\nUsage of request_body authentication method is not recommended and should be avoided. scopes: string array (optional)\nThe scopes required for the access token.\ncache_ttl: Duration (optional)\nHow long to cache the token received from the token endpoint. Defaults to the token expiration information from the token endpoint (the value of the expires_in field) if present. If the token expiration inforation is not present and cache_ttl is not configured, the received token is not cached. If the token expiration information is present in the response and cache_ttl is configured the shorter value is taken. If caching is enabled, the token is cached until 5 seconds before its expiration. To disable caching, set it to 0s. The cache key calculation is based on the values of token_url, client_id, client_secret and the scopes properties.\nheader: object (optional, overridable)\nDefines the name and scheme to be used for the header. Defaults to Authorization with scheme Bearer. If defined, the name property must be set. If scheme is not defined, no scheme will be prepended to the resulting JWT.\nExample 12. Strategy configuration type: oauth2_client_credentials config: header: name: X-My-Token token_url: https://my-auth.provider/token client_id: foo client_secret: bar auth_method: basic_auth ttl: 10m scopes: - baz - zap Authorization Expression Authorization expressions define, as the name implies expressions for authorization purposes and have the following properties:\nexpression string (mandatory)\nThe expression to execute.\nmessage string (optional)\nThe message to include into the error if the expression fails.\nExample 13. Example expression using CEL The expression below determine whether attributes property of a subject object (also shown below) has at least one key that starts with the group prefix, and ensure that all group-like keys have list values containing only strings that end with @acme.co.\nsubject id: \u0026#34;foobar\u0026#34; attributes: group1: [\u0026#34;admin@acme.co\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;analyst@acme.co\u0026#34;] labels: [\u0026#34;metadata\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;prod\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;pii\u0026#34;] groupN: [\u0026#34;forever@acme.co\u0026#34;] expression: | subject.attributes.exists(c, c.startsWith(\u0026#39;group\u0026#39;)) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; subject.attributes .filter(c, c.startsWith(\u0026#39;group\u0026#39;)) .all(c, subject.attributes[c] .all(g, g.endsWith(\u0026#39;@acme.co\u0026#39;))) message: No groups ending with @acme.co present ByteSize ByteSize is actually a string type, which adheres to the following pattern: ^[0-9]+(B|KB|MB)$\nSo with 10B you can define the byte size of 10 bytes and with 2MB you can say 2 megabytes.\nCORS CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) headers can be added and configured by making use of this type. This functionality allows for advanced security features to quickly be set. If CORS headers are set, then heimdall does not pass preflight requests to its decision pipeline, instead the response will be generated and sent back to the client directly. Following properties are supported:\nallowed_origins: string array (optional)\nList of origins that may access the resource. Defaults to all, if not set, but any of the other CORS options are configured.\nallowed_methods: string array (optional)\nList of methods allowed when accessing the resource. This is used in response to a preflight request. Defaults to GET, POST, HEAD, PUT, DELETE and PATCH if not set, but any of the other CORS options are configured.\nallowed_headers: string array (optional)\nList of request headers that can be used when making the actual request.\nexposed_headers: string array (optional)\n\u0026#34;Allow-List\u0026#34; of headers that clients are allowed to access.\nallow_credentials: boolean (optional)\nIndicates whether the response to the request can be exposed when the credentials flag is true. When used as part of a response to a preflight request, this indicates whether the actual request can be made using credentials. Defaults to false if not set, but any of the other CORS options are configured.\nmax_age: Duration (optional)\nIndicates how long the results of a preflight request can be cached. Defaults to 0 seconds if not set, but any of the other CORS options are configured.\nExample 14. Possible configuration allowed_origins: - example.org allowed_methods: - HEAD - PATCH allow_credentials: true max_age: 10s Duration Duration is actually a string type, which adheres to the following pattern: ^[0-9]+(ns|us|ms|s|m|h)$\nSo with 10s you can define the duration of 10 seconds and with 2h you can say 2 hours.\nEndpoint The Endpoint type defines properties required for the communication with an endpoint.\nIf only the URL is required to be set, you can specify it by using just a string. If more than the URL is required to be specified, following properties are available:\nurl string (mandatory)\nThe actual url of the endpoint. Depending on the mechanism, a URL can be templated\nIf templating is used, user info, scheme and host parts of the URL cannot be templated. Attempts to do so will result in runtime errors. method string (optional)\nThe HTTP method to use while communicating with the endpoint. If not set POST is used.\nretry Retry (optional)\nWhat to do if the communication fails. If not configured, no retry attempts are done.\nauth Authentication Strategy (optional)\nAuthentication strategy to apply, if the endpoint requires authentication.\nheaders map of strings (optional)\nHTTP headers to be sent to the endpoint.\nThese headers are not analyzed by heimdall and are just forwarded to the endpoint. E.g. if you configure the Content-Encoding to something like gzip, the service behind the used endpoint might fail to answer, as it would expect the body to be compressed. enable_http_cache bool (optional)\nWhether HTTP caching according to RFC 7234 should be used. Defaults to false if not otherwise stated in the description of the configuration type, making use of the endpoint property. If set to true heimdall will strictly follow the requirements from RFC 7234 and cache the responses if possible and reuse these if still valid.\nIf the endpoint referenced by the URL does not provide any explicit expiration time, no heuristic freshness lifetime is calculated. Heimdall treats such responses as not cacheable. Example 15. Endpoint configuration as string http://foo.bar Example 16. Structured Endpoint configuration url: http://foo.bar method: GET retry: give_up_after: 5s max_delay: 1s auth: type: api_key config: name: foo value: bar in: cookie headers: X-My-First-Header: foobar X-My-Second-Header: barfoo enable_http_cache: true Error Condition This type supports definition of conditions, under which an error handler mechanism should execute its logic. Such conditions are required for all error handler mechanisms, but the default one. All condition elements are evaluated using boolean and. Following conditions are possible:\nerror: Error Descriptor array (mandatory)\nA list with error types to match. Configured entries are evaluated using a boolean or logic.\nrequest_cidr: string array (optional)\nA list with CIDR entries to match. Configured entries are evaluated using a boolean or logic.\nrequest_headers: string array map (optional)\nA map with header names and the corresponding values to match. Configured entries are evaluated using a boolean or logic. This holds also true for the header values. Wildcards like * or */* can be used as well, where * matches any value and */* matches only those value, which consist of a type and a subtype. E.g */* would match application/json and text/plain, but not text. The actual matching happens always case-insensitive.\nSome HTTP headers, like Accept or Content-Type hold not only the actual MIME type, but may also contain optional parameters. These parameters are ignored while matching the values. Example 17. Complex Error Condition configuration This example shows in principle all possible combinations. The actual values and the amount of them will for sure differ in your particular case. However, for showing the idea, the complexity of this example is enough.\nerror: - type: precondition_error # OR - type: authorization_error # AND request_cidr: - 192.168.0.0/16 # OR - 10.0.0.0/8 # AND request_headers: accept: - text/html # OR - text/plain # OR Content-Type: - application/json This condition evaluates to true only if all parts of it (error, request_cidr, request_headers) evaluate to true. With * error evaluates to true, if the encountered error was either precondition_error or authorization_error. * request_cidr evaluates to true, if the request came from an IP in either 192.168.0.0/16 or 10.0.0.0/8 range. And * request_headers evaluates to true, if either the HTTP Accept header contains one of text/html, or /, or the HTTP Contet-Type header contains application/json.\nExample 18. Simple Error Condition configuration This example is a very simple one, showing just the usage of the error attribute:\nerror: - type: authentication_error This condition evaluates to true, if the encountered error was authentication_error raised by any of the configured authenticators.\nError Descriptor Describes an error to match in Error Conditions.\nFollowing configuration properties are available:\ntype: Error Type (mandatory)\nAn error type to match.\nraised_by: string (optional)\nThe identifier of the pipeline mechanism, which raised this error.\nheimdall does not verify the integrity of the pipeline mechanism identifier configured using raised_by on start or while loading rules. Thus, if there is no mechanism with the given identifier, the error will not match. Example 19. Error Descriptor configuration type: authentication_error raised_by: my_oauth2_authenticator Here the descriptor says, the expected error is of type authentication_error and should have been raised by a mechanism with the id my_oauth2_authenticator.\nError/State Type Heimdall defines a couple of error/state types, which it uses to signal errors. Those, which are marked with (*) are available for configuring Error Conditions via Error Descriptors. All can be used to define overrides for the HTTP response codes.\nFollowing types are available:\naccepted - this is the only state type in this list and is used to signal, the matched decision pipeline has been executed successfully, so the request can be forwarded to the upstream service. The response of that type results by default in a 200 OK response.\nauthentication_error (*) - used if an authenticator failed to verify authentication data available in the request. E.g. an authenticator was configured to verify a JWT and the signature of it was invalid. If none of the authenticators used in a pipeline were able to authenticate the user, and the default error handler was used to handle such error, it will by default result in a 401 Unauthorized response.\nauthorization_error (*) - used if an authorizer failed to authorize the subject. E.g. an authorizer is configured to use an expression on the given subject and request context, but that expression returned with an error. Error of this type results by default in 403 Forbidden response if the default error handler was used to handle such error.\ncommunication_error (*) - this error is used to signal a communication error while communicating to a remote system during the execution of the pipeline of the matched rule. Timeouts of DNSs errors result in such an error. Error of this type results by default in 502 Bad Gateway HTTP code if handled by the default error handler.\ninternal_error - used if heimdall run into an internal error condition while processing the request. E.g. something went wrong while unmarshalling a JSON object, or if there was a configuration error, which couldn’t be raised while loading a rule, etc. Results by default in 500 Internal Server Error response to the caller.\nmethod_error - this error is used to signal that a matched rule does not allow usage of the HTTP method used to submit the request. Error of this type results by default in 405 Method Not Allowed HTTP code.\nno_rule_error - this error is used to signal, there is no matching rule to handle the given request. Error of this type results by default in 404 Not Found HTTP code.\nprecondition_error (*) - used if the request does not contain required/expected data. E.g. if an authenticator could not find a cookie configured. Error of this type results by default in 400 Bad Request HTTP code if handled by the default error handler.\nKey Store This type configures a key store holding keys and corresponding certificate chains. PKCS#1, as well as PKCS#8 encodings are supported for private keys.\nWhile loading a key store following verifications are done:\nUniqueness of key ids and rejection of key stores which violate this condition (see also Key-Id Lookup)\nCorrelation of keys and certificates to build a valid certificate chain for every given key if certificates are present. If the correlation fails, an error is raised and heimdall will refuse to start.\nCertificate chain validation. If the chain is invalid, an error is raised and heimdall will refuse to start.\nFollowing configuration properties are available:\npath: string (mandatory)\nThe path to the PEM file with the cryptographic material.\npassword: string (optional)\nIf the key material is protected with a password, this property can be set to decipher it. Password protection is only supported for PKCS#8 encoded keys\nIf the key store contains multiple keys and these keys are password protected, same password must be used for all of these. Example 20. Example configuration path: /path/to/keystore.pem password: VeryInsecure! Respond This type enables instructing heimdall to preserve error information and provide it in the response body to the caller, as well as to use HTTP status codes deviating from those heimdall would usually use. The configuration, which can be done using this type affects only the behavior of the default error handler.\nFollowing properties are supported:\nverbose: boolean (optional)\nBy making use of this property you can instruct heimdall to preserve error information and provide it in the response body to the caller. Defaults to false.\nHeimdall supports MIME type negotiation. So, if the client sets the HTTP Accept header to e.g. application/json, and Heimdall run into an unhandled internal error condition, in addition to responding with 500 Internal Server Error, it will render an error message, like shown below, if verbose has been set to true.\n{ \u0026#34;code\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;internal error\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;whatever led to the error\u0026#34; } The message will however contain just high-level information, like \u0026#34;failed to parse something\u0026#34;, but will not contain any stack traces.\nwith: ResponseOverride set (optional)\nThis property enables mapping between response/error types used by heimdall and the corresponding HTTP status codes. Each entry must be from the list of the supported Error/State Types and contain exactly one property named code, which then defines the desired mapping.\nExample 21. Making error responses verbose and changing the HTTP codes for some errors verbose: true with: authentication_error: code: 404 authorization_error: code: 404 Retry Implements an exponential backoff strategy for endpoint communication. It increases the backoff exponentially by multiplying the max_delay with 2^(attempt count)\ngive_up_after: Duration (optional)\nSets an upper bound on the maximum time to wait between two requests. Default to 0, which means no upper bound.\nmax_delay: Duration (mandatory)\nThe initial backoff.\nExample 22. Retry configuration In this example the backoff will be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 60, …​\ngive_up_after: 60s max_delay: 1s Scopes Matcher Scopes matcher is a configuration type allowing configuration of different strategies to match required scopes. In its simplest shape it can be just an array of strings (implemented by the Exact) scope matcher. To cover many use cases, different strategies are available and described in the following sections.\nRegardless of the strategy, each matcher can explicitly be configured and supports the following configuration properties:\nmatching_strategy - the type of the mathing strategy.\nvalues - the list of scope patterns\nExact This the simplest matcher and is automatically selected, if just an array of strings is configured as shown in the following snippet:\n- foo - bar However, as written in the Scopes Matcher section, it can also explicitly be selected by setting matching_strategy to exact and defining the required scopes in the values property.\nExample 23. Essentially same configurations matching_strategy: exact values: - foo - bar - foo - bar Hierarchic This matcher enables matching hierarchical scopes, which use . as separator. Imagine your system is organized that way, that it defines namespaces for different services like this:\nmy-service being the top namespace\nmy-service.booking - being the namespace of the booking service\nmy-service.orders - being the namespace of the orders service\nmy-service.orders.partners - being the namespace of the order service for partners and\nmy-service.orders.customers - being the namespace of the order service for customers\nBasically you’ve established an identity for each of your services (this is comparable to how SPIFFE IDs are organized and also used for).\nNow, imagine you use these namespaces as scope values to limit the usage of the issued tokens. In such situations the hierarchic scope matcher can become handy if you would like to assert any scope of the token must be in e.g. the my-service or the my-service.orders namespace.\nThis matcher can only be used by explicitly setting the matching_strategy to hierarchic and defining the required patterns in the values property.\nExample 24. Matching of hierarchic scopes matching_strategy: hierarchic values: - my-service This configuration will ensure all scopes withing the scope or scp claim are within the my-service namespace. So scope claim like\n{ \u0026#34;scope\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;my-service.orders\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;my-service.orders.customers\u0026#34;] } would match, but\n{ \u0026#34;scope\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;not-my-service\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;my-service.orders.customers\u0026#34;] } would not match.\nWildcard This matcher enables matching scopes using wildcards. It goes beyond the Hierarchic scope matcher by enabling usage of wildcards.\nThis matcher can only be used by explicitly setting the matching_strategy to wildcard and defining the required patterns in the values property.\nSubject This configuration type enables extraction of subject information from responses received by Heimdall from authentication services. Following properties are available.\nid: string (mandatory)\nA GJSON Path pointing to the id of the subject in the JSON object.\nattributes: string (optional)\nA GJSON Path pointing to the attributes of the subject in the JSON object. Defaults to @this.\nExample 25. Extracting subject id from an OAuth2 Introspection endpoint response. This example shows how to extract the subject id from an OAuth2 Introspection endpoint response and set the subject attributes to the entire response\nid: sub attributes: @this Setting attributes was actually not required, as @this would be set by default anyway.\nExample 26. Extracting subject id from an Ory Kratos \u0026#34;whoami\u0026#34; endpoint response This example shows how to extract the subject id from an Ory Kratos \u0026#34;whoami\u0026#34; endpoint response and set the subject attributes to the entire response. attributes is not configured, so default is used.\nid: identity.id Session Lifespan This configuration type enables the configuration of session lifespans, used for session validation for those authenticators, which act on non-standard protocols. Following properties are available.\nactive: string (optional)\nA GJSON Path pointing to the field describing the \u0026#34;active\u0026#34; status of the session in the corresponding JSON object. The actual value in that field should be convertable to a bool type. If not provided, or not found in the session object, the session is considered to be \u0026#34;active\u0026#34;. \u0026#34;active\u0026#34; means it can be used and represent a valid session between the authentication system and the subject, the session has been issued to.\nissued_at: string (optional)\nA GJSON Path pointing to the field in the corresponding JSON object, describing the time, when the session object has been issued. If not provided or not found, the issuance time is not considered during session validation.\nnot_before: string (optional)\nA GJSON Path pointing to the field in the corresponding JSON object describing the time, until which the session object is not allowed to be used. If not provided or not found, the corresponding time is not considered during session validation.\nnot_after: string (optional)\nA GJSON Path pointing to the field in the corresponding JSON object describing the time, after which the session object is not allowed to be used. If not provided or not found, the corresponding time is not considered during session validation.\ntime_format: string (optional)\nSince different authentication system use different representations for time strings, this property allows the definition of the time format/layout used by the authentication system. Defaults to Unix Epoch time stamp.\nYou can use the following Go Playground link to test your time format settings. validity_leeway: Duration (optional)\nEnables definition of an allowed time drift between the authentication system and heimdall for the validation of the session validity. Defaults to 0.\nExample 27. Making use of session information received from Ory’s Kratos A typical response from Kratos\u0026#39; whoami endpoint looks like follows (stripped to the most interesting parts):\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1338410d-c473-4503-a96a-53efa06e2531\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;active\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;expires_at\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2021-10-15T15:58:57.683338Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;authenticated_at\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2021-10-14T15:58:57.683338Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;issued_at\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2021-10-14T15:58:57.683338Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;identity\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;9496bbd5-f426-473f-b087-c7df853f274a\u0026#34;, ... } } To enable usage of these properties in Heimdall, you can configure the Session Lifespan as follows:\nactive: active issued_at: issued_at not_before: authenticated_at not_after: expires_at time_format: \u0026#34;2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999Z07\u0026#34; validity_leeway: 10s Example 28. Making use of session information received from a compliant OAuth2 authorization service A typical response from a token introspection endpoint looks like follows:\n{ \u0026#34;active\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;client_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;l238j323ds-23ij4\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;username\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;jdoe\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;scope\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;read write dolphin\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sub\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Z5O3upPC88QrAjx00dis\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;aud\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://protected.example.net/resource\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;iss\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://server.example.com/\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;exp\u0026#34;: 1419356238, \u0026#34;iat\u0026#34;: 1419350238, \u0026#34;extension_field\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;twenty-seven\u0026#34; } To enable usage of these properties in Heimdall, you can configure the Session Lifespan as follows:\nactive: active issued_at: iat not_after: exp validity_leeway: 10s As you see, there is no need to define the time format as the times values appearing in the responses from an introspection endpoint are Unix Epoch time stamps.\nTLS Following are the supported TLS configuration properties:\nkey_store: Key Store (mandatory)\nThe key store containing the cryptographic material. At least one private key and the corresponding certificate must be present.\nkey_id: string (optional)\nIf the key_store contains multiple keys, this property can be used to specify the key to use (see also Key-Id Lookup). If not specified, the first key is used. If specified, but there is no key for the given key id present, an error is raised and heimdall will refuse to start.\nmin_version: string (optional)\nThe minimal TLS version to support. Can be either TLS1.2 or TLS1.3. Defaults to TLS1.3.\ncipher_suites: string array (optional)\nCan be configured if min_version is set to TLS1.2. If min_version is set to TLS1.3 the configured values are ignored.
