Heimdall is a cloud native identity aware proxy and access control decision service inspired by the Zero Trust idea. It brings together authentication and authorization systems and can be thought as an orchestrator for these in front of your services, allowing however completely retaining control even without the need for any type of maintenance in your own code.

The /public endpoint is as the name implies public. Every request to it should be forwarded as is.
The /user endpoint should only be accessible to users with the role user.
The /admin endpoint should only be accessible to users with the role admin and
the /private endpoint, as well as any other potentially exposed endpoint should not be accessible at all.</description></item><item><title>Contour Integration</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/proxies/contour/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Aug 2023 17:10:52 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/proxies/contour/</guid><description>Contour is an ingress controller for Kubernetes, implementing a control plane for Envoy edge and a service proxy.
Prerequisites Integration with Contour requires heimdall being operated in Decision Operation Mode exposing Envoy’s external authorization GRPC protocol.
Being security first ingress controller, Contour enforces TLS for communication between Envoy and any external authorization service. For that reason, heimdall must be configured with an appropriate key material and certificate. Same is actually also true for the http route definition of the actual upstream service.</description></item><item><title>Pipelines</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/concepts/pipelines/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2022 22:29:36 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/concepts/pipelines/</guid><description>Overview Pipelines are specified in rules and are used to authenticate and authorize the particular requests, as well as to handle encountered errors.
As described in the Discover heimdall chapter and also shown in the diagram below, central aspects of heimdall are upstream specific pipelines, which allow you orchestrating different services to authenticate, enrich and authorize incoming HTTP requests, transform the resulting subject information into a format, or obtain credentials required for the communication with the particular upstream services.</description></item><item><title>Emissary Ingress Integration</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/proxies/emissary/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Aug 2023 15:23:41 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/proxies/emissary/</guid><description>Emissary-Ingress is an Envoy-powered open source, high performance ingress controller and API Gateway for Kubernetes from Ambassador Labs. Integration happens by letting Emissary-Ingress delegating authentication and authorization to heimdall. If heimdall answers with a 2XX code, the ingress controller will grant access and forwards the original request to the upstream service. Otherwise, the response from heimdall is returned to the client.
Prerequisites Integration with Emissary-Ingress requires heimdall being operated in Decision Operation Mode.</description></item><item><title>Mechanisms</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/concepts/mechanisms/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2022 22:31:36 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/concepts/mechanisms/</guid><description>Mechanism Categories All supported mechanisms fall into the following five categories, each implementing different mechanisms types (addressing different protocols or scenarios):
Authenticators, which inspect HTTP requests for presence of authentication objects, like e.g. the presence of a specific cookie. If such objects exist, authenticators verify the related authentication status and obtain information about the corresponding subject. A subject, could be a user who tries to use particular functionality of the upstream service, a machine (if you have machine-2-machine interaction), or something different.</description></item><item><title>Envoy Integration</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/proxies/envoy/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Dec 2022 00:13:59 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/proxies/envoy/</guid><description>Envoy is a high performance distributed proxy designed for single services and applications, as well as a communication bus and “universal data plane” designed for large microservice “service mesh” architectures.
Prerequisites Integration with Envoy proxy requires heimdall being operated in Decision Operation Mode.
Integration Options Envoy makes integration with external authorization services, like heimdall possible via an External Authorization filter in two ways
either via HTTP

So, mechanisms is what you can see and select in a catalogue (though, in case of heimdall you have to define that catalogue first) to compile your car and the rule is your car with real components and behaviour. In that sense when you define a rule, you specify which mechanisms should it be built from and whether you would like some &amp;#34;tuning&amp;#34; to be applied to better suit your needs.</description></item><item><title>Envoy Gateway Integration</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/proxies/envoy_gateway/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 13:02:43 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/proxies/envoy_gateway/</guid><description>Envoy Gateway is an open source project for managing Envoy Proxy as a Kubernetes-based application gateway by making use of the Gateway API resources.

So, there must be some structure allowing all of that. That structure is defined by the so-called rule sets.
A rule set can be considered to be just a file containing a list of rules and some additional meta information, like format version, name of the rule set and alike. Rule sets do also allow ordering of rules, e.</description></item><item><title>HAProxy Integration</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/proxies/haproxy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Aug 2023 07:32:14 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/proxies/haproxy/</guid><description>HAProxy (High Availability Proxy) is a popular open source, fast, and reliable solution providing load balancer and reverse proxy features for TCP- and HTTP-based applications, capable handling heavy load traffic and rerouting requests seamlessly across multiple workloads (e.g. web, application, database).
Vanilla HAProxy HAProxy is highly extensible thanks to Lua scripting support. For that reason the vanilla HAProxy does not implement any means of external authorization support and requires custom Lua code to achieve integration with heimdall.</description></item><item><title>Operating Modes</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/concepts/operating_modes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2022 22:29:36 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/concepts/operating_modes/</guid><description>Decision Mode In this mode you can integrate heimdall with existing reverse proxies, or API gateways (like Kong, NGNIX, Envoy, Traefik and much more)
Figure 1. Decision Deployment In this mode heimdall can be integrated with most probably all modern API gateways and reverse proxies as a so-called &amp;#34;authentication middleware&amp;#34;. Here the reverse proxy, respectively API gateway integrating with heimdall, will forward requests to heimdall by making use of its decision service endpoint for authentication and authorization purposes.</description></item><item><title>Istio Service Mesh Integration</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/proxies/istio/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Oct 2024 20:49:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/proxies/istio/</guid><description>Istio is an open-source service mesh that extends Kubernetes’ capabilities, providing a uniform way to observe, secure, and connect microservices. It also functions as a Kubernetes-based application gateway, using either its built-in Ingress Gateway, the Kubernetes Ingress, or the Gateway API resources for configuration.
Prerequisites A kubernetes cluster
Deployed Istio (See here for installation options)
heimdall installed and operated in Decision Operation Mode.
To allow heimdall communicating with services running in the mesh, add the certificate of the CA used by Istio to heimdall’s trust store.</description></item><item><title>NGINX Integration</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/proxies/nginx/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2022 00:14:49 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/proxies/nginx/</guid><description>NGINX is an HTTP and reverse proxy server which became famous as one of the fastest web servers out there, heimdall can be integrated with by making use of the ngx_http_auth_request_module. In such setup, NGINX delegates authentication and authorization to heimdall. If heimdall answers with a 2XX code, NGINX grants access and forwards the original request to the upstream service. If heimdall returns 401 or 403, the access is denied with the corresponding error code.</description></item><item><title>Traefik Proxy Integration</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/proxies/traefik/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jun 2022 18:59:49 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/proxies/traefik/</guid><description>Traefik Proxy is a modern HTTP proxy and load balancer for microservices, heimdall can be integrated with via the ForwardAuth Middleware. If heimdall answers with a 2XX code, traefik grants access and forwards the original request to the upstream service. Otherwise, the response from heimdall is returned to the client.
Prerequisites Integration with traefik requires heimdall being operated in Decision Operation Mode.
Traefik makes use of X-Forwarded-* HTTP headers to forward the HTTP method, protocol, host, etc.</description></item><item><title>Integration with OPA</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/authz/opa/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Nov 2022 09:00:41 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/authz/opa/</guid><description>The Protect an Application quickstart guide, describing the steps required to protect an application with heimdall, shows already how OPA can be used with heimdall. This document provides some further examples.
Example 1: Sharing Service Imagine you have a sharing service, e.g. to let friends share all their photos with each other and the API looks roughly as follows:
GET /&amp;lt;user&amp;gt;/photos returns all the photos of the user either to the owner of the photo collection itself or to its friends.</description></item><item><title>Integration with OpenFGA</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/authz/openfga/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Mar 2024 12:32:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/authz/openfga/</guid><description>OpenFGA is inspired by Google’s Zanzibar, Google’s Relationship Based Access Control system and allows easily implementing authorization for any kind of application relying on Role-Based Access Control with additional Attribute-Based Access Control capabilities.
This guide is based on the OpenFGA’s official Getting Started guide and highlights the relevant differences. It mimics a RESTful document management API, allowing listing, creating, reading, updating, and deleting documents. The API consists of two endpoints:</description></item><item><title>First-Party Authentication with OpenID Connect</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/authn/oidc_first_party_auth/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Nov 2022 09:00:41 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/authn/oidc_first_party_auth/</guid><description>By the end of this guide, you’ll have a functional setup where heimdall uses Keycloak to authenticate users and route requests based on their authentication status and roles for role-based access control.
Although this guide uses Keycloak as identity provider (IDP), you can achieve the same results with Zitadel, Boruta, or any other OpenID Connect-compatible IDP.

the static startup configuration, which is the scope of this document and
the configuration of rules, respectively rule sets, which you can find here.
Elements in the static configuration set up the services, like decision service, which basically define the entry points, heimdall will listen to, the observability capabilities, like logging, the mechanism catalogue, the default rule, as well as the rule providers (these elements are not expected to change often).</description></item><item><title>CLI</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/operations/cli/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jun 2022 18:57:50 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/operations/cli/</guid><description>Usage Patterns heimdall [command] [flags] [arguments] Use heimdall help to get overview about available commands, respectively heimdall [command] help for help on any command.
Flag’s usage:

In more complex scenarios, a rule can reconfigure parts of the mechanisms being used. The specific parts that can be reconfigured or overridden depend on the mechanism itself and are described in the mechanism-specific documentation. Reconfiguration is always limited to the particular rule’s pipeline and does not affect other rules.
