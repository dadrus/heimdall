:toc:

The link:{{< relref "/docs/getting_started/protect_an_app.adoc" >}}[Protect an Application] quickstart guide, describing the steps required to protect an application with heimdall, shows already how https://www.openpolicyagent.org/[OPA] can be used with heimdall. This document provides some further examples.

== Example 1: Sharing Service

Imagine you have a sharing service, e.g. to let friends share all their photos with each other and the API looks roughly as follows:

* `GET /<user>/photos` returns all the photos of the user either to the owner of the photo collection itself or to its friends.

To achieve this using OPA, we would need something like the following https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/[Rego] policy:

[source, rego]
----
package share_photos

default allow = false

# user is owner. that is, the value of first path
# fragment is equal to the identified user
allow { split(input.path, "/")[1] == input.user }

# user is friend. that is, the user referenced by the
# first path fragment has the identified user in its friends list
allow { data.friends[split(input.path, "/")[1]][_] == input.user }
----

It expects two pieces of information in the payload to the OPA instance:

* the actual user, making the request and
* the path to witch the request is made

So something like this: `{ "input": { "user": "alice", "path": "bob/photos" } }`. Since the Rego policy defined above returns just `true` or `false`, the corresponding response from the OPA endpoint would be `{ "result": true }` or `{ "result": false }`. Given this and assuming the above policy can be used by making requests to `\https://opa.local/v1/data/share_photos/policy/allow`, the configuration of the link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/authorizers.adoc#_remote" >}}[Remote Authorizer] would look like follows:

[source, yaml]
----
id: photos_access
type: remote
config:
  endpoint:
    url: https://opa.local/v1/data/share_photos/policy/allow
  payload: |
    { "input": { "user": {{ quote .Subject.ID }}, "path": {{ quote .RequestURL.Path }} } }
  expressions:
  - expression: |
      Payload.result == true
----

Here the entire authorization happens within heimdall and is completely outsourced from the business logic of our sharing service.

== Example 2: Membership Verification

Imagine you have a billing service, which requires information about the membership of a user to different groups, which represent different subscription options for you entire offering. Depending on this information your service would create invoices with different amounts. The imaginary API of that service could look like follows:

* `POST /create_invoice` to invoice the identified user.

You could perform the required query to OPA entirely in your service and use the retrieved group memberships then. Alternatively, you could outsource the communication to OPA to heimdall and deal only with the group membership information in your service. Compared to the link:{{< relref "#_example_1_sharing_service" >}}[Sharing Service] example, this time heimdall would not perform any authorization, but rather enrich the subject information with further information. This way, we're not going to use a link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/authorizers.adoc" >}}[Authorizer], but a link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/contextualizers.adoc#_generic" >}}[Generic Contextualizer] instead. As with link:{{< relref "#_example_1_sharing_service" >}}[Sharing Service] example, there is a need for a https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/[Rego] policy, which could look like this:

[source, rego]
----
package invoice

groups_graph[data.groups[subject].name] = edges {
  edges := data.groups[subject].member_of
}

member_of_groups[subject] = groups {
  groups_graph[subject]
  groups := graph.reachable(groups_graph, {subject})
}

groups {
  member_of_groups[input.user][_]
}
----

It expects just one piece of information, namely the actual user, making the request. So something like this: `{ "input": { "user": "alice" } }`. Since the Rego policy defined above returns a list of groups, the corresponding response from the OPA endpoint would be `{ "result": ["group1", "group2"] }`. Given this and assuming the above policy can be used by making requests to `\https://opa.local/v1/data/invoice/policy/groups` and the authentication to that endpoint requires basic authentication, the configuration of the link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/contextualizers.adoc#_generic" >}}[Generic Contextualizer] would look like follows:

[source, yaml]
----
id: billing_contextualizer
type: generic
config:
  endpoint:
    url: https://opa.local/v1/data/invoice/policy/groups
    auth:
      type: basic_auth
      config:
        user: MyOpaUser
        password: SuperSecretPassword
  payload: |
    { "input": { "user": {{ quote .Subject.ID }} } }
----

Upon successful execution of the corresponding request, the response from the OPA endpoint will be stored in the `Outputs["billing_contextualizer"]` field. That way, you can use that information in a link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/finalizers.adoc" >}}[Finalizer] to forward the group membership to the billing service API.
