description: Finalizers are the last steps executed in a rule pipeline and can e.g. create a special representation of the subject to be made available to the upstream service. This page describes the available finalizer types in detail.
---

:toc:

Some finalizers may support or require additional configuration. The corresponding properties are annotated with `mandatory`, respectively `optional` to denote configuration requirement, as well as with `overridable`, `not overriddable` and `partially overridable` to indicate whether the property can be overridden in a rule pipeline.

== Noop

As the name implies, this finalizer does nothing. This finalizer type also doesn't have any configuration options.

To enable the usage of this finalizer, you have to set the `type` property to `noop`.

.Noop finalizer configuration
====
[source, yaml]
----
id: foo
type: noop
----
====

== Header

This finalizer enables transformation of a link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/evaluation_objects.adoc#_subject" >}}[`Subject`] and the link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/evaluation_objects.adoc#_outputs" >}}[`Outputs`] objects into HTTP headers. It can also be used to map information from the original link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/evaluation_objects.adoc#_request" >}}[`Request`] into headers expected by the upstream service.

To enable the usage of this finalizer, you have to set the `type` property to `header`.

Configuration using the `config` property is mandatory. Following properties are available:

* *`headers`*: _string map_ (mandatory, overridable)
+
Enables configuration of arbitrary headers with any values build from available information (See also link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/evaluation_objects.adoc#_templating" >}}[Templating]).

.Header finalizer configuration
====
[source, yaml]
----
id: foo
type: header
config:
  headers:
    X-User-ID: '{{ quote .Subject.ID }}'
    X-User-Email: '{{ index .Subject.Attributes "email" | quote }}'
    Host: '{{ .Request.Header "Host" | quote  }}'
----
====

== Cookie

This finalizer enables transformation of a link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/evaluation_objects.adoc#_subject" >}}[`Subject`] and the link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/evaluation_objects.adoc#_outputs" >}}[`Outputs`] objects into cookies. It can also be used to map information from the original link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/evaluation_objects.adoc#_request" >}}[`Request`] into cookies expected by the upstream service.

To enable the usage of this finalizer, you have to set the `type` property to `cookie`.

Configuration using the `config` property is mandatory. Following properties are available:

* *`cookies`*: _string map_ (mandatory, overridable)
+
Enables configuration of arbitrary cookies with any values build from available information (See also link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/evaluation_objects.adoc#_templating" >}}[Templating]).

.Cookie finalizer configuration
====
[source, yaml]
----
id: foo
type: cookies
config:
  cookies:
    user_id_cookie: '{{ quote .Subject.ID }}'
    user_email_cookie: '{{ index .Subject.Attributes "email" | quote }}'
----
====

== JWT

This finalizer enables transformation of the link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/evaluation_objects.adoc#_subject" >}}[`Subject`] and the link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/evaluation_objects.adoc#_outputs" >}}[`Outputs`] objects into custom claims within a https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519[JWT]. The resulting token is then made available to your upstream service in either the HTTP `Authorization` header (using the `Bearer` scheme) or in a custom header. Your upstream service can verify the JWT's signature using heimdall's JWKS endpoint to retrieve the necessary public keys/certificates.

To enable this finalizer, set the `type` property to `jwt`.

Configuration using the `config` property is mandatory. The following properties are available:

* *`signer`*: _link:{{< relref "/docs/configuration/types.adoc#_signer" >}}[Signer]_ (mandatory, not overridable)
+
Defines the key material for signing the JWT, as well as the `iss` claim.

* *`claims`*: _string_ (optional, overridable)
+
A link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/evaluation_objects.adoc#_templating" >}}[template] specifying custom claims for the JWT. The template can use link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/evaluation_objects.adoc#_values" >}}[`Values`], link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/evaluation_objects.adoc#_outputs" >}}[`Outputs`], and link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/evaluation_objects.adoc#_subject" >}}[`Subject`] objects.

* *`values`*: _map of strings_ (optional, overridable)
+
A key-value map accessible as link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/evaluation_objects.adoc#_values" >}}[`Values`] in the template engine for rendering claims. Values in this map can also be templated with access to link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/evaluation_objects.adoc#_subject" >}}[`Subject`] and link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/evaluation_objects.adoc#_outputs" >}}[`Outputs`].

* *`ttl`*: _link:{{< relref "/docs/configuration/types.adoc#_duration" >}}[Duration]_ (optional, overridable)
+
Defines the JWT's validity period. Defaults to 5 minutes. Heimdall automatically sets the `iat` and `nbf` claims to the current system time, and `exp` is calculated based on the `ttl` value.

* *`header`*: _object_ (optional, not overridable)
+
Specifies the HTTP header `name` and optional `scheme` for passing the JWT. Defaults to `Authorization` with scheme `Bearer`. If defined, `name` is required, and if `scheme` is omitted, the JWT is set as a raw value.

The generated JWT is cached until 5 seconds before expiration. The cache key is computed based on the finalizer's configuration, the link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/evaluation_objects.adoc#_subject" >}}[`Subject`], and the link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/evaluation_objects.adoc#_outputs" >}}[`Outputs`] attributes.

.JWT finalizer configuration
====
[source, yaml]
----
id: jwt_finalizer
type: jwt
config:
  ttl: 5m
  header:
    name: X-Token
  claims: |
    {
      {{ $user_name := .Subject.Attributes.identity.user_name -}}
      "email": {{ quote .Subject.Attributes.identity.email }},
      "email_verified": {{ .Subject.Attributes.identity.email_verified }},
      "name": {{ if $user_name }}{{ quote $user_name }}{{ else }}{{ quote $email }}{{ end }},
      "extra": {{ .Values | toJson }}
    }
----
In a rule that references the `jwt_finalizer`, additional claims can be dynamically inserted into the `"extra"` claim without redefining `claims`:

[source,yaml]
----
- id: some_rule
  # Other rule properties
  execute:
  - # Other mechanisms
  - finalizer: jwt_finalizer
    config:
      values:
        foo: bar
        user_id: '{{ .Subject.ID }}'
  - # Other mechanisms
----

== OAuth2 Client Credentials

This finalizer drives the https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-4.4[OAuth2 Client Credentials Grant] flow to obtain a token, which should be used for communication with the upstream service. By default, as long as not otherwise configured (see the options below), the obtained token is made available to your upstream service in the HTTP `Authorization` header with `Bearer` scheme set. Unlike the other finalizers, it does not have access to any objects created by the rule execution pipeline.

To enable the usage of this finalizer, you have to set the `type` property to `oauth2_client_credentials`.

Configuration using the `config` property is mandatory. Following properties are available:

* *`token_url`*: _string_ (mandatory, not overridable)
+
The token endpoint of the authorization server.

* *`client_id`*: _string_ (mandatory, not overridable)
+
The client identifier for heimdall.

* *`client_secret`*: _string_ (mandatory, not overridable)
+
The client secret for heimdall.

* *`auth_method`*: _string_ (optional, not overridable)
+
The authentication method to be used according to https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-2.3.1[RFC 6749, Client Password]. Can be one of

** `basic_auth` (default if `auth_method` is not set): With that authentication method, the `"application/x-www-form-urlencoded"` encoded values of `client_id` and `client_secret` are sent to the authorization server via the `Authorization` header using the `Basic` scheme.

** `request_body`: With that authentication method the `client_id` and `client_secret` are sent in the request body together with the other parameters (e.g. `scopes`) defined by the flow.
+
WARNING: Usage of `request_body` authentication method is not recommended and should be avoided.

* *`scopes`*: _string array_ (optional, overridable)
+
The scopes required for the access token.

* *`cache_ttl`*: _link:{{< relref "/docs/configuration/types.adoc#_duration" >}}[Duration]_ (optional, overridable)
+
How long to cache the token received from the token endpoint. Defaults to the token expiration information from the token endpoint (the value of the `expires_in` field) if present. If the token expiration inforation is not present and `cache_ttl` is not configured, the received token is not cached. If the token expiration information is present in the response and `cache_ttl` is configured the shorter value is taken. If caching is enabled, the token is cached until 5 seconds before its expiration. To disable caching, set it to `0s`. The cache key calculation is based on the entire `oauth2_client_credentials` configuration without considering the `header` property.

* *`header`*: _object_ (optional, overridable)
+
Defines the `name` and `scheme` to be used for the header. Defaults to `Authorization` with scheme `Bearer`. If defined, the `name` property must be set. If `scheme` is not defined, no scheme will be prepended to the resulting JWT.
