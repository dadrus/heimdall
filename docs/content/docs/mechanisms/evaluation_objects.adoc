:toc:

E.g. in one case, you want to have access to a particular request header. In another case you would like to add specific data to the resulting JWT created by heimdall. And in yet another case, you may want to check whether some expectations apply. These capabilities are described on this page.

== Objects

Objects represent state during the execution of a particular rule. These are entities either created or used by specific mechanisms, and can represent things like the actual request, the authenticated subject of the request, and many others.

=== Principal

A Principal represents an identity of an entity associated with the current request — such as a user, service, or machine — and verified by a particular link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/authenticators.adoc">}}[authenticator]. Principals are immutable and ephemeral — they exist only for the lifetime of a single request.

Each principal has the following properties:

* *`ID`*: _string_
+
The unique identifier of the principal.

* *`Attributes`*: _map_
+
A key-value map containing all known attributes about the principal.

Each object of this type can be represented as a JSON object. Here are some examples:

.Principal created by an Anonymous Authenticator
====
[source, javascript]
----
Principal = {
  ID: "anonymous",
  Attributes: {}
}
----
====

.Principal created by an OAuth2 Introspection Authenticator
====
[source, javascript]
----
Principal = {
  ID: "foobar",
  Attributes: {
    "sub": "foobar",
    "exp": "1670600805",
    "jti": "7b91ed8a-0251-4e02-8d51-9792785851e8",
    "iat": "1670600305",
    "iss": "https://testauthserver.local",
    "nbf": "1670600305",
    "extra": {
        "foo": ["bar", "baz"]
    }
  }
}
----
====

=== Subject

A Subject is a higher-order concept — a key-value collection of link:{{< relref "#_principal" >}}[Principals] verified by all successfully executed link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/authenticators.adoc">}}[authenticators], where the keys represent principal names and the values are the corresponding Principal objects.

Like Principals, Subjects are immutable and ephemeral, existing only for the lifetime of a single request.

In addition to its Principal collection, each Subject exposes the following virtual properties:

* *`ID`*: _string_
+
The unique identifier of the Subject. Its value is taken from the Principal named "default".

* *`Attributes`*: _map_
+
A key-value map containing all attributes of the Principal named "default".

Each object of this type can be thought as a JSON object. Here an example:

.Subject created by two authenticators — one authenticating the user and one the device being used
====
[source, javascript]
----
Subject = {
  "default": Principal {
    ID: "62302d83-da01-4ba6-9440-119728757455",
    Attributes: {
      "email": "john.doe@example.com"
    }
  },
  "device": Principal {
    ID: "597ef6b5-64fc-49e3-ad1e-7599046908d9",
    Attributes: {
      "os": "Ubuntu 25.04"
    }
  }
}
----
====

=== Request

This object contains information about the request handled by heimdall and has the following attributes and methods:

* *`Method`*: _string_
+
The HTTP method used, like `GET`, `POST`, etc.

[#_url_captures]
* *`URL`*: _URL_
+
The URL of the matched request. This object has the following properties and methods:

** *`Captures`*: _map_
+
Allows accessing of the values captured by the named wildcards used in the matching path expression of the rule.

** *`Host`*: _string_
+
The host part of the url.

** *`Hostname()`*: _method_
+
This method returns the host name stripping any valid port number if present.

** *`Port()`*: _method_
+
Returns the port part of the `Host`, without the leading colon. If `Host` doesn't contain a valid numeric port, returns an empty string.

** *`Path`*: _string_
+
The path part of the url.

** *`Query()`*: _method_
+
The parsed query with each key-value pair being a string to array of strings mapping.

** *`RawQuery`*: _string_
+
The raw query part of the url.

** *`Scheme`*: _string_
+
The HTTP scheme part of the url.

** *`String()`*: _method_
+
This method returns the URL as valid URL string of a form `scheme:host/path?query`.

* *`ClientIPAddresses`*: _string array_
+
The list of IP addresses the request passed through with the first entry being the ultimate client of the request. Only available if heimdall is configured to trust the client, sending this information, e.g. in the `X-Forwarded-From` header (see also link:{{< relref "/docs/services/main.adoc#_trusted_proxies" >}}[trusted_proxies] configuration for more details).

* *`Header(name)`*: _method_,
+
This method expects the name of a header as input and returns its value as a `string`. If the header is not present in the HTTP request an empty string (`""`) is returned. If a header appears multiple times in the request, the returned `string` is a comma separated list of all values.
+
NOTE: A single header may be a comma separated list of actual values as well. Best example is the `Accept` header, which might be set to e.g. `text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8`).

* *`Cookie(name)`*: _method_,
+
This method expects the name of a cookie as input and returns the value of it as `string`. If the cookie is not present in the HTTP request an empty string (`""`) is returned.

* *`Body()`*: _method_,
+
The parsed body with contents depending on the `Content-Type` header. Supported content types are any MIME types with `json` or `yaml` subtype, as well as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. If MIME type is unsupported, the method returns a string with the actual body contents.
+
NOTE: The actual request body is parsed only on the first use of this function. All subsequent calls return the cached result.
+
.Example results
====
If the `Content-Type` header is set to `application/json` and the actual request body is a valid JSON object, shown below
[source, json]
----
{ "context": "heimdall" }
----
The call to the `Body()` function will return exactly this representation as a map.


If the `Content-Type` header is set to `application/yaml` and the actual request body is a valid YAML object, shown below
[source, yaml]
----
context: heimdall
----
The call to the `Body()` function will return `{ "context": "heimdall" }` representation as a map.


If the `Content-Type` header is set to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and the actual request body is a valid object, shown below
[source, yaml]
----
context=heimdall
----
The call to the `Body()` function will return this representation as a map with each value being a string array. In this particular case as `{ "context": [ "heimdall" ] }`.
====

Here is an example for a request object:

.Example request object
====
[source, javascript]
----
Request = {
  Method: "GET",
  Url: {
    Scheme: "https",
    Host: "localhost",
    Path: "/test/abc",
    RawQuery: "baz=zab&baz=bar&foo=bar",
    Captures: { "value": "abc" }
  },
  ClientIP: ["127.0.0.1", "10.10.10.10"]
}
----
====

=== Outputs

This object represents a pipeline execution specific key value map. It is used by pipeline steps to store or read results of particular step executions. Step id is used as a key and the value is the corresponding result.

Example:

[source, javascript]
----
Outputs = {
    "id_1": ["a", "b"],
    "id_2": { "foo": "bar", "baz": false }
}
----

=== Payload

This object represents the contents of a payload, like the request body or a response body. The contents depend on the MIME-Type of the payload. For `json`, `yaml` or `x-www-form-urlencoded` encoded payload, the object is transformed to a JSON object. Otherwise, it is just a string.

Here some examples:

.Structured payload
====

The following JSON object is a typical response from OPA.

[source, javascript]
----
Payload = { "result": true }
----
====

.Unstructured payload
====
[source, javascript]
----
Payload = "SomeStringValue"
----
====

=== Error

This object represents an error, which has been raised during the execution of a rule and is available in `if` link:{{< relref "#_expressions">}}[CEL expressions] of link:{{< relref "error_handlers.adoc">}}[Error Handlers]. Following properties are available:

* *`Source`*: _string_
+
The ID of the mechanism, which raised the error.

* *`StepID`*: _string_
+
The ID of the pipeline step, which raised the error

Proper error handling requires attention to the actual _link:{{< relref "/docs/configuration/types.adoc#_errorstate_type" >}}[error type]_ available via `type(Error)`.

=== Values

This object represents a key value map, with both, the key and the value being of string type. Though, the actual values can be templated (see (link:{{< relref "#_templating" >}}[Templating]). The contents and the variables available in templates depend on the configuration of the particular mechanism, respectively the corresponding override in a rule.

Here is an example:

.Example values object
====
[source, javascript]
----
Values = {
  "some-key-1": "value-1",
  "some-key-2": "value-2"
}
----
====

== Templating

Some mechanisms support templating using https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/[Golang Text Templates]. Templates can act on all objects described above (link:{{< relref "#_principal" >}}[Principal], link:{{< relref "#_subject" >}}[Subject], link:{{< relref "#_outputs" >}}[Outputs], link:{{< relref "#_request" >}}[Request], link:{{< relref "#_payload" >}}[Payload] and link:{{< relref "#_values" >}}[Values]). Which exactly are supported is mechanism specific.

To ease the usage, all https://masterminds.github.io/sprig/[sprig] functions, except `env` and `expandenv`, as well as the following functions are available:

* `urlenc` - Encodes a given string using url encoding. Is handy if you need to generate request body or query parameters e.g. for communication with further systems.

* `atIndex` - Implements python-like access to arrays and takes as a single argument the index to access the element in the array at. With index being a positive values it works exactly the same way, as with the usage of the built-in index function to access array elements. With negative index value, one can access the array elements from the tail of the array. -1 is the index of the last element, -2 the index of the element before the last one, etc.
+
Example: `{{ atIndex 2 [1,2,3,4,5] }}` evaluates to `3` (behaves the same way as the `index` function) and `{{ atIndex -2 [1,2,3,4,5] }}` evaluates to `4`.

* `splitList` - Splits a given string using a separator (part of the sprig library, but not documented). The result is a string array.
+
Example: `{{ splitList "/" "/foo/bar" }}` evaluates to the `["", "foo", "bar"]` array.


.Rendering a JSON object
====
Imagine, we have a `POST` request for the URL `\https://foobar.baz/zab?foo=bar`, with a header `X-Foo` set to `bar` value, for which heimdall was able to identify a subject consisting of a single "default" principal with `ID=foo` and which `Attributes` contain an entry `email: foo@bar`, then you can generate a JSON object with this information with the following template:

[source, gotemplate]
----
{
  "subject_id": {{ quote .Subject.ID }},
  "email": {{ quote .Subject.Attributes.email }},
  "request_url": {{ quote .Request.URL }},
  "foo_value": {{ index .Request.URL.Query.foo 0 | quote }}
  "request_method": {{ quote .Request.Method }},
  "x_foo_value": {{ .Request.Header "X-Foo" | quote }},
  "whatever": {{ .Outputs.whatever | quote }}
}
----

Please note that `.Subject.ID` and `.Subject.Attribute` is a syntactic sugar for `.Subject.default.ID`, respectively `.Subject.default.Attributes`.

Please also note how the access to the `foo` query parameter is done. Since `.Request.URL.Query.foo` returns an array of strings, the first element is taken to render the value for the `foo_value` key.

This will result in the following JSON object:

[source, json]
----
{
    "subject_id": "foo",
    "email": "foo@bar.baz",
    "request_url": "https://foobar.baz/zab?foo=bar",
    "foo_value": "bar",
    "request_method": "POST",
    "x_foo_value": "bar",
    "whatever": "some value"
}
----
====

.Access to captured path segments
====
Imagine, we have a `POST` request to the URL `\https://foobar.baz/zab/1234`, with `1234` being the identifier of a file, which should be updated with the contents sent in the body of the request, and you would like to control access to the aforesaid object using e.g. OpenFGA. This can be achieved with the following authorizer:

[source, yaml]
----
id: openfga_authorizer
type: remote
config:
  endpoint:
    url: https://openfga/stores/files/check
  payload: |
    {
      "user": "user:{{ .Subject.ID }}",
      "relation": "write",
      "object": "file:{{ .Request.URL.Captures.id }}"
    }
  expressions:
  - expression: |
      Payload.allowed == true
----

Please note how the `"object"` is set in the `payload` property above. When the `payload` template is rendered and for the above said request heimdall was able to identify the subject with `ID=foo`, following JSON object will be created:

[source, json]
----
{
  "user": "user:foo",
  "relation": "write",
  "object": "file:1234"
}
----
====

You can find further examples as part of mechanism descriptions, supporting templating.

== Expressions

Expressions can be used to execute conditional logic. Currently, only https://github.com/google/cel-spec[CEL] is supported as expression language. All standard CEL functions, as well as https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/google/cel-go/ext#pkg-functions[extension functions], are available. The set of available link:{{<  relref "#_objects" >}}[evaluation objects] depends on the specific mechanism in use.

In addition to the built-in CEL functions, extension methods, and methods on evaluation objects, the following custom functions are also available:

* `at` - Provides Python-like access to array elements. A positive index behaves like standard `[]` array access. A negative index accesses elements from the end of the array (`-1` is the last element, `-2` the second-last, etc.).
+
Example: `[1,2,3,4,5].at(2)` returns `3` and `[1,2,3,4,5].at(-2)` returns `4`.

* `last` - returns the last element of an array, or nil if the array is empty.
+
Example: `[1,2,3,4,5].last()` returns `5`

* `regexFind` - returns the first (leftmost) match of a regular expression within a string.
+
Example: `"abcd1234".regexFind("[a-zA-Z][1-9]")` returns `"d1"`.

* `regexFindAll` - returns an array of all matches of a regular expression within a string.
+
Example: `"123456789".regexFindAll("[2,4,6,8]")` returns `["2","4","6","8"]`.

* `split` - splits a string by the given separator and returns an array of strings.
+
Example: `"/foo/bar/baz".split("/")` returns `["", "foo", "bar", "baz"]`.

* `networks` - accepts a single CIDR string or an array of CIDR strings, and returns a matcher object that can be used to check whether an IP address belongs to one of the specified ranges.
+
Example: `Request.ClientIPAddresses.all(ip in networks(["172.16.0.0/12", "192.168.0.0/16"]))` checks whether all IPs in the `Request.ClientIPAddresses` array belong to the specified IP ranges.


Some examples:

.Evaluate Payload object
====

Given the following Payload object

[source, javascript]
----
Payload = { "result": true }
----

a CEL expression to check whether the `result` attribute is set to `true`, would look as follows:

[source, cel]
----
Payload.result == true
----
====

.Check whether the user represented by the "default" Principal is member of the admin group
====
[source, cel]
----
has(Subject.Attributes.groups) &&
   Subject.Attributes.groups.exists(g, g == "admin")
----

As with templates `Subject.ID` and `Subject.Attributes` is a syntactic sugar for `Subject.default.ID`, respectively `Subject.default.Attributes`

====

.Access the last path part of the matched URL
====
[source, cel]
----
Request.URL.Path.split("/").last()
----
====

.Check if an error has been raised by an authenticator with the ID "foo"
====
[source, cel]
----
type(Error) == authentication_error && Error.Source == "foo"
----
====
