This document describes a very simple use case in which you'll see heimdall's Decision service in action.

== Prerequisites

* link:{{< relref "/docs/operations/install.adoc" >}}[Download Heimdall] in your flavor.
* https://docs.docker.com/install/[Docker] (optionally) and
* https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[docker-compose] (optionally)

== Configure

heimdall can be configured via environment variables, as well as using a configuration file. For simplicity reasons, we'll use a configuration file here. So create a config file named `config.yaml` with the following content:

[source, yaml]
----
log:
  level: info  # <1>

serve:
  decision:
    trusted_proxies:  # <2>
      - 0.0.0.0/0

rules:
  mechanisms:
    authenticators:  # <3>
      - id: do_nothing
        type: noop
      - id: anon
        type: anonymous
      - id: reject_requests
        type: unauthorized
    unifiers:  # <4>
      - id: do_nothing
        type: noop
      - id: create_jwt
        type: jwt

  default:  # <5>
    methods:
      - GET
      - POST
    execute:
      - authenticator: reject_requests
      - unifier: create_jwt

  providers:
    file_system:  # <6>
      src: /heimdall/conf/rules.yaml
      watch: true
----
<1> Here we are setting the log level to `info` to be able to see any log output. By default, heimdall logs on `error` log level.
<2> Configures heimdall's decision service to trust requests from all sources. This allows usage of `X-Forwarded-*` headers. This configuration is only required if you want to try out the docker compose example from below.
<3> Configures a couple of authenticators - the `noop` authenticator, which does nothing, the `anonymous` authenticator, which treats every request as anonymous (creates a subject with its id set to anonymous) and the `unauthorized` authenticator, which rejects every request with `401 Unauthorized` HTTP code.
<4> Configured a couple of unifiers - the `noop` unifier, which does nothing and the jwt` unifier, which transforms the information about the subject into a JWT.
<5> Configures the default rule, which will obviously reject every request.
<6> Configures a `file_system` provider, which allows heimdall loading rules from the local filesystem; here from the `/heimdall/conf/rule.yaml` file.


With that configuration and without any additional rules, heimdall would reject all requests with `401 Unauthorized`. But it has a `file_system` provider configured, which makes heimdall expect the referenced rules file already on startup. To make it more usable, create a `rules.yaml` file with the following content:

[source, yaml]
----
version: "1alpha2"
rules:
- id: rule1  # <1>
  match:
    url: http://<**>/public
  execute:
    - authenticator: do_nothing
    - unifier: do_nothing

- id: rule2  # <2>
  match:
    url: http://<**>/anonymous
  execute:
    - authenticator: anon
----

This file contains two rules:

<1> This rule should match the `\http://<**>/public` url and accept every request without performing any authentication and unification.
<2> This rule should match the `\http://<**>/anonymous` url. It uses the `anon` authenticator from our mechanisms definitions and since it does not specify a unifier, the unifier from the default rule `create_jwt` is used.

== Run Standalone
Run heimdall specifying the configuration file from above

If you're using a binary, put the `rules.yaml` file into the `/heimdall/conf` directory (as heimdall will look the `rules.yaml` file in it according to our configuration from above) just execute

[source, bash]
----
$ ./heimdall serve decision -c config.yaml
----

The above command will start heimdall in a link:{{< relref "concepts.adoc#_decision_api_mode" >}}[decision] operation mode. By default, the service will be served on port `4456`.

Otherwise, if you've built a Docker image, run heimdall in the link:{{< relref "concepts.adoc#_decision_api_mode" >}}[decision] operation mode via

[source, bash]
----
$ docker run -t -v $PWD:/heimdall/conf -p 4456:4456 \
  dadrus/heimdall:latest serve decision -c /heimdall/conf/config.yaml
----

In both cases, you'll see similar output to

[source, bash]
----
2022-08-04T07:40:12+02:00 INF No opentracing provider configured. Tracing will be disabled.
2022-08-04T07:40:12+02:00 INF Instantiating in memory cache

2022-08-04T07:40:12+02:00 INF Metrics service starts listening on: :9000
2022-08-04T07:40:12+02:00 INF Decision service starts listening on: :4456
----

Ignore the warnings. They are expected as we've neither configured a rule provider, nor have we configured a key store for JWT signing purposes. Nevertheless, the default rule can be used.

== Run Integrated

Alternatively, if you would like to have an environment close to a real scenario, you could make use of docker compose. Create the following `docker-compose.yaml` file for this purpose:

[source, yaml]
----
version: "3"

services:
  proxy:
    image: traefik:2.9.1
    ports:
      - 9090:9090
    command: >
      --providers.docker=true
      --providers.docker.exposedbydefault=false
      --entryPoints.http.address=":9090"
      --accesslog --api=true --api.insecure=true
    volumes:
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro"
    labels:
      - traefik.enable=true
      - traefik.http.routers.traefik_http.service=api@internal
      - traefik.http.routers.traefik_http.entrypoints=http
      - traefik.http.middlewares.heimdall.forwardauth.address=http://heimdall:4456  # <1>
      - traefik.http.middlewares.heimdall.forwardauth.authResponseHeaders=Authorization

  heimdall:  # <2>
    image: dadrus/heimdall:latest
    volumes:
      - ./config.yaml:/heimdall/conf/config.yaml:ro
      - ./rules.yaml:/heimdall/conf/rules.yaml:ro
    command: -c /heimdall/conf/config.yaml serve decision

  upstream:  # <3>
    image: containous/whoami:latest
    labels:
      - traefik.enable=true
      - traefik.http.services.whoami.loadbalancer.server.port=80
      - traefik.http.routers.whoami.rule=PathPrefix("/")
      - traefik.http.routers.whoami.middlewares=heimdall
----

This setup contains three services:

<1> is Traefik, which is used to dispatch the incoming requests and also forward all of them to heimdall first.
<2> is heimdall, configured to use the configuration and the rule files from above
<3> is a small service, which just echoes back whatever it receives.

== Use

Send some request to heimdall's decision service endpoint.

If you've started heimdall as described in link:{{< relref "#_run_standalone" >}}[Run Standalone], that can be achieved by making a call to heimdall's decision endpoint:

[source, bash]
----
$ curl -v 127.0.0.1:4456/foobar
----

If you've started heimdall as described in link:{{< relref "#_run_integrated" >}}[Run Integrated], that can be achieved by making a call to the port 9090 exposed by Traefik:

[source, bash]
----
$ curl -v 127.0.0.1:9090/foobar
----

In both cases, the default rule will apply, and you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response.

Try sending requests to the `/public` and the `/anonymous` endpoints and see what happens. In both cases, the response will be an HTTP `200 OK`. And the response from the `/anonymous` endpoint will also contain an `Authorization` header containing a JWT, e.g. as shown below.

[source, bash]
----

You should also be able to see similar output as below from the heimdall's instance.

[source, bash]
