This document describes a simple use case in which you'll see Heimdall's Proxy in action. Here, we'll create a minimal but complete environment for running Heimdall with containers. Compared to the link:{{< relref "decision_api_quickstart.adco" >}}[Decision API Quickstart], you'll also define a very simple rule without which heimdall won't know where to forward the requests to.

== Prerequisites

* https://docs.docker.com/install/[Docker] and https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[docker-compose]

== Configure

Heimdall can be configured via environment variables, as well as using a configuration file. For simplicity reasons, we'll use a configuration file here.

. Create a config file (`config.yaml`) with the following content:
+
[source, yaml]
----
log:
  level: info                     // <1>

pipeline:
  authenticators:
    - id: anonymous_authenticator // <2>
      type: anonymous
  authorizers:
    - id: deny_all_requests       // <3>
      type: deny
    - id: allow_all_requests      // <4>
      type: allow
  mutators:
    - id: create_jwt              // <5>
      type: jwt

rules:
  default:                        // <6>
    methods:
      - GET
      - POST
    execute:
      - authenticator: anonymous_authenticator
      - authorizer: deny_all_requests
      - mutator: create_jwt

  providers:
    file_system:                  // <7>
      src: /heimdall/conf/rule.yaml
      watch: true
----
<1> Here we are setting the log level to `info` to be able to see any log output. By default, Heimdall logs on `error` log level.
<2> Configures the `anonymous` authenticator.
<3> Configures the `deny` authorizer.
<4> Configures the `allow` authorizer. It will be used in our rule to allow requests.
<5> Configures the `jwt` mutator.
<6> Configures the default rule.
<7> Configures the `file_system` provider, which will allow loading of our rule from the file system.
+
Put together, this configuration will let Heimdall create a JSON Web Token (JWT) with `sub` claim set to `anonymous` for every request on every URL for the HTTP methods GET and POST. The JWT itself will be put into the `Authorization` header as a bearer token. Since the above default rule cannot be used to forward requests to the upstream service, the `deny` authenticator will reject the requests for us and enforce a configuration of an authorization mechanism in a specific rule, which we're going to define next.

. Create a rule file (`rule.yaml`) with the following contents:
+
[source, yaml]
----
- id: test-rule
  url: http://<**>/<**>
  upstream: http://upstream
  execute:
    - authorizer: allow_all_requests
----
+
This rule will match any host and path and forward the request to our upstream service (which we're ging to define next). In addition, it reuses the configuration from the default rule. Here, the methods, which are allowed, as well as the authorizers and mutators. So we don't need to define them here.

. Create or copy the following `docker-compose.yaml` file and modify it to include the correct paths to your `config.yaml` and `rule.yaml` files:
+
[source, yaml]
----
version: "3"

services:
  heimdall: // <1>
    image: dadrus/heimdall:latest
    volumes:
      # Mount your config file:
      - ./config.yaml:/heimdall/conf/config.yaml:ro
      # Mount your rule file:
      - ./rule.yaml:/heimdall/conf/rule.yaml:ro
    ports:
      - 4455:4455
    command: -c /heimdall/conf/config.yaml serve proxy
  upstream: // <2>
    image: containous/whoami:latest
----
<1> Configures Heimdall service to use our config and rule files and to run in proxy operation mode.
<2> Configures the "upstream" service. Here it is a very simple service, which just echoes back everything it receives.

== Run
Run docker compose:

[source, bash]
----
$ docker-compose up
----

Docker will automatically download the required container images. Then, Heimdall will start in the link:{{< relref "concepts.adoc#_proxy_mode" >}}[proxy] mode and run with the configuration details set in the previous steps. You'll then be able to see an output similar to

[source, bash]

Ignore the warnings. They are expected and will not have any effects in this case.

== Use

Send a request to heimdall's proxy endpoint:

[source, bash]
----
$ curl -v 127.0.0.1:4455/foobar
----

Here, Heimdall will match our rule and forward the request to the `upstream` service. On completion, you should see the `Authorization` header in the proxied response from the `upstream` service, like in the output below:

[source, bash]
----

You should also be able to see similar output as below from the docker-compose environment:

[source, bash]
----

----

Try using another method, like e.g. DELETE to see, what will happen then. Or change the `rule.yaml` file (you don't need to restart the environment as the file provider will watch the `rule.yaml` faile for changes) to let it match only on a specific path and send the request again using another path. You'll then see the `deny` authorizer in action.
