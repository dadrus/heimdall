This document describes a simple use case in which you'll see heimdall's Proxy service in action. Here, we'll create a minimal but complete environment for running heimdall with containers.

== Prerequisites

* https://docs.docker.com/install/[Docker] and
* https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[docker-compose]

== Configure

Heimdall can be configured via environment variables, as well as using a configuration file. For simplicity reasons, we'll use a configuration file here.

. Create a config file (`config.yaml`) with the following content:
+
[source, yaml]
----
log:
  level: info  # <1>

rules:
  mechanisms:
    authenticators:
    - id: anonymous_authenticator  # <2>
      type: anonymous
    - id: noop
      type: noop
    authorizers:
    - id: deny_all_requests  # <3>
      type: deny
    - id: allow_all_requests  # <4>
      type: allow
    unifiers:
    - id: create_jwt  # <5>
      type: jwt
    - id: noop
      type: noop

  default:  # <6>
    methods:
      - GET
      - POST
    execute:
      - authenticator: anonymous_authenticator
      - authorizer: deny_all_requests
      - unifier: create_jwt

  providers:
    file_system:  # <7>
      src: /heimdall/conf/rule.yaml
      watch: true
----
<1> Here we are setting the log level to `info` to be able to see any log output. By default, heimdall logs on `error` log level.
<2> Configures the `anonymous` authenticator.
<3> Configures the `deny` authorizer.
<4> Configures the `allow` authorizer. It will be used in our rule to allow requests.
<5> Configures the `jwt` unifier.
<6> Configures the default rule.
<7> Configures the `file_system` provider, which will allow loading of our rule from the file system.
+
Put together, this configuration will let heimdall create a JSON Web Token (JWT) with `sub` claim set to `anonymous` for every request on every URL for the HTTP methods GET and POST. The JWT itself will be put into the `Authorization` header as a bearer token. Since the above default rule cannot be used to forward requests to the upstream service, the `deny` authenticator will reject the requests for us and enforce a configuration of an authorization mechanism in a specific rule, which we're going to define next.

. Create a rule file (`rule.yaml`) with the following contents:
+
[source, yaml]
----
version: "1alpha2"
rules:
- id: rule1  # <1>
  match:
    url: http://<**>/anonymous
  forward_to:
    host: upstream
  execute:
    - authorizer: allow_all_requests

- id: rule2  # <2>
  match:
    url: http://<**>/public
  forward_to:
    host: upstream
  execute:
    - authenticator: noop
    - authorizer: allow_all_requests
    - unifier: noop
----
+
<1> This rule matches any host and the `/anonymous` path and forwards the request to our upstream service (which we're going to define next). In addition, it reuses the configuration from the default rule. Here, the methods, which are allowed, as well as the authorizers and unifiers. So we don't need to define them here.
<2> This rule matches any host and the `/public` path and forwards the request as the previous rule to our upstream service. This rule doesn't perform any kind of request verification or transformation.

. Create or copy the following `docker-compose.yaml` file and modify it to include the correct paths to your `config.yaml` and `rule.yaml` files:
+
[source, yaml]
----
version: "3"

services:
  heimdall:  # <1>
    image: dadrus/heimdall:latest
    volumes:
      # Mount your config file:
      - ./config.yaml:/heimdall/conf/config.yaml:ro
      # Mount your rule file:
      - ./rule.yaml:/heimdall/conf/rule.yaml:ro
    ports:
      - 4455:4455
    command: -c /heimdall/conf/config.yaml serve proxy

  upstream:  # <2>
    image: containous/whoami:latest
----
<1> Configures heimdall to use our config and rule files and to run in proxy operation mode.
<2> Configures the "upstream" service. Here it is a very simple service, which just echoes back everything it receives.

== Run
Run docker compose:

[source, bash]
----
$ docker-compose up
----

Docker will automatically download the required container images. Then, heimdall will start in the link:{{< relref "concepts.adoc#_proxy_mode" >}}[proxy] mode and run with the configuration details set in the previous steps. You'll then be able to see an output similar to

[source, bash]

----

Ignore the warnings. They are expected and will not have any effects in this case.

== Use

Send a request to heimdall's proxy endpoint:

[source, bash]
----
$ curl -v 127.0.0.1:4455/foobar
----

Here, heimdall will not match any of the defined rules, which will result in the execution of the default rule. Thus, you'll see `403 Forbidden` as answer.

Try sending requests to the `/public` and the `/anonymous` endpoints and see what happens. In both cases, the response will be an HTTP `200 OK`. And the response from the `/anonymous` endpoint will also contain an `Authorization` header containing a JWT, e.g. as shown below.

[source, bash]

You should also be able to see similar output as below from the docker-compose environment:

[source, bash]
