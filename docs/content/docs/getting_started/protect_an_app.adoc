description: This simple quickstart guide walks you through the steps required to protect an application with heimdall. Here, you'll learn how you can make use of heimdall as an authentication & authorization proxy in front of your application and also how you could implement Edge-level Authorization Architecture (EAA) with heimdall's help.
---

:toc:

== Overview

In this guide we're going to configure two setups, both protecting a service which exposes a couple of endpoints:

* The `/public` endpoint is as the name implies public. Every request to it should be forwarded as is.
* The `/user` endpoint should only be accessible to users with the role `user`.
* The `/admin` endpoint should only be accessible to users with the role `admin` and
* the `/private` endpoint, as well as any other potentially exposed endpoint should not be accessible at all. So all requests should be rejected.

For authentication purposes, we're going to use JWTs, containing the respective role. The authorization will happen with the help of Open Policy Agent (OPA).

In both setups, we're going to create minimal but complete environments using docker compose with

* https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/[traefik] as an edge proxy,
* https://hub.docker.com/r/containous/whoami/[containous/whoami] (that service just echoes back everything it receives) which mimics our service exposing the abovesaid endpoints,
* an https://nginx.org/en/[NGINX] server serving the public key for the verification purposes of the JWTs mentioned above (it just mimics the JWKS endpoint typically exposed by an OIDC provider),
* https://www.openpolicyagent.org/[OPA], which evaluates the above said authorization policy and
* heimdall, orchestrating everything to implement the above said requirements.

NOTE: This and similar quickstarts, demonstrating other (integration) options are also available on https://github.com/dadrus/heimdall/tree/main/examples/docker-compose/quickstarts[GitHub].

== Prerequisites

To be able to follow this guide, you'll need the following tools installed locally:

* https://docs.docker.com/install/[Docker],
* https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[docker-compose], and
* a text editor of your choice.

== Configure

. Heimdall can be configured via environment variables, as well as using a configuration file. For simplicity reasons, we'll use a configuration file here. So create a config file named `heimdall-config.yaml` with the following contents:
+
[source, yaml]
----
log: # <1>
  level: debug

tracing:
  enabled: false

metrics:
  enabled: false

serve: # <2>
  decision:
    trusted_proxies:
    - 0.0.0.0/0

mechanisms: # <3>
  authenticators:
    - id: deny_all # <4>
      type: unauthorized
    - id: anon # <5>
      type: anonymous
    - id: jwt_auth # <6>
      type: jwt
      config:
        jwks_endpoint: http://idp:8080/.well-known/jwks
        assertions:
          issuers:
            - demo_issuer
  authorizers:
    - id: opa # <7>
      type: remote
      config:
        endpoint: http://opa:8181/v1/data/{{ .Values.policy }}
        payload: "{}"
        expressions:
          - expression: |
              Payload.result == true
  finalizers:
    - id: create_jwt # <8>
      type: jwt
      config:
        signer:
          key_store:
            path: /etc/heimdall/signer.pem
    - id: noop # <9>
      type: noop

default_rule: # <10>
  execute:
    - authenticator: deny_all
    - finalizer: create_jwt

providers:
  file_system: # <11>
    src: /etc/heimdall/rules.yaml
    watch: true
----
<1> Since heimdall emits logs on `error` level by default, and we would like to see what is going on, we are setting the log level to `debug`. This way, we'll see not only the results of a particular rule execution (which is what you would see if we set the log level to `info`), but also what is going in a rule. In addition, we disable tracing and metrics collection as these are pulled by default to an OTEL agent to avoid error statements related to unavailability of the agent. You can find more information about available observability options in the link:{{< relref "/docs/operations/observability.adoc#_logging" >}}[Observability] chapter.
<2> This configuration instructs heimdall to trust `X-Forwarded-*` headers from any sources. We need it here for integration purposes with Traefik, which uses these headers while forwarding requests to heimdall and which IP depends on your local docker configuration. Never do this in production and use allowed IPs instead! Please take also a look at the documentation of link:{{< relref "/docs/services/decision.adoc#_trusted_proxies" >}}[trusted_proxies] property and link:{{< relref "/docs/operations/security.adoc#_http_header_security_considerations" >}}[Security Considerations] for more details.
<3> Here we define our link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/catalogue.adoc" >}}[catalogue of mechanisms] to be used in link:{{< relref "/docs/rules/regular_rule.adoc" >}}[upstream service specific rules]. In this case we define authenticators, authorizer and finalizers
<4> These two lines define the `link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/authenticators.adoc#_unauthorized" >}}[unauthorized]` authenticator named `deny_all`. It rejects all requests.
<5> These two lines define the `link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/authenticators.adoc#_anonymous" >}}[anonymous]` authenticator named `anon`. It allows any request passing through and creates a subject with ID set to `anonymous`. You can find more information about the subject and other objects link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/evaluation_objects.adoc#_subject" >}}[here].
<6> This and the following lines define and configure the `link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/authenticators.adoc#_jwt" >}}[jwt]` authenticator named `jwt_auth`. With the given configuration it will check whether a request contains an `Authorization` header with a bearer token in JWT format and validate it using key material fetched from the JWKS endpoint. It will reject all requests without a valid JWT or create a subject with ID set to the value of the `sub` claim from the token and add also add all claims as key-value map to subject's Attribute property.
<7> Here we define and configure a `link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/authorizers.adoc#_remote" >}}[remote]` authorizer named `opa`. Please note, how we allow overriding of particular settings, which application you'll find below, when we define the rules.
<8> The following lines define the `link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/finalizers.adoc#_jwt" >}}[jwt]` finalizer. With the given configuration, it will create a jwt out of the subject object with standard claims and set the `sub` claim to the value of subject's ID. The key material used for signature creation purpose is taken from the referenced key store.
<9> These two lines conclude the definition of our mechanisms catalogue and define the `link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/finalizers.adoc#_noop" >}}[noop]` finalizer, which as the type implies, does nothing.
<10> With the above catalogue in place, we can now define a link:{{< relref "/docs/rules/default_rule.adoc" >}}[default rule], which will kick in if no other rule matches the request. In addition, it acts as a link:{{< relref "/docs/concepts/rules.adoc#_default_rule_inheritance" >}}[base] for the definition of regular (upstream service specific) rules. In this case it defines a secure default link:{{< relref "/docs/concepts/pipelines.adoc#_authentication_authorization_pipeline" >}}[authentication & authorization pipeline], which refuses any request by making use of the `deny_all` authenticator, and if the regular rule overrides that authenticator, will create a JWT thanks to the used `jwt` finalizer.
<11> The last few lines of the configure the link:{{< relref "/docs/rules/providers.adoc#_filesystem" >}}[`file_system`] provider, which allows loading of regular rules from the file system. Btw. the provider is configured to watch for changes. So you can modify the rules, we're going to create, while playing around.

. Create a file, named `signer.pem` with the following content. This is our key store with a private key, you've seen in the configuration above.
+
[source, yaml]
----

-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----
----
+
WARNING: Do not use it for purposes beyond this tutorial!

. Now, create a rule file named `upstream-rules.yaml`, which will implement the authentication and authorization requirements of our service, and copy the following contents to it:
+
[source, yaml]
----
version: "1alpha4"
rules:
- id: demo:public  # <1>
  match:
    routes:
      - path: /public
  forward_to:
    host: upstream:8081
  execute:
  - authenticator: anon
  - finalizer: noop

- id: demo:protected  # <2>
  match:
    routes:
      - path: /:user
        path_params:
          - name: user
            type: glob
            value: "{user,admin}"
  forward_to:
    host: upstream:8081
  execute:
  - authenticator: jwt_auth
  - authorizer: opa
    config:
      values:
        policy: demo/can_access
      payload: |
        {
          "input": {
            "role": {{ quote .Subject.Attributes.role }},
            "path": {{ quote .Request.URL.Path }}
          }
        }
----
+
<1> This rule matches our `/public` endpoint and forwards the request to our upstream service. It doesn't perform any kind of request verification or transformation.
<2> This rule matches the `/user` and the `/admin` endpoints and performs the required authentication as well as authorization steps.
+
NOTE: Please note, that we don't define any finalizer in the pipeline of the second rule. Since we have a default rule with a finalizer configured, it is reused here. There is no need for other rules as well as our default rule will block requests to any other endpoints.

. Having everything related to heimdall configuration, let us now create a policy, OPA is going to use. So, create a file named `policy.rego` with the following contents.
+
[source, rego]
----
package demo

default can_access = false # <1>

can_access { split(input.path, "/")[1] == input.role } # <2>
----
+
Here, we say, our policy `can_access` is located in the `demo` package. The policy itself is pretty simple and evaluates only to true or false.
+
<1> Per default, the `can_access` policy evaluates to false.
<2> And it evaluates only to true, if the last path fragment of the request is equal to the user's role.

. Let us now configure NGINX to expose a static endpoint serving a JWKS document under the `.well-known` path, so heimdall is able to verify the JWTs, we're going to use. Create a file named `idp.nginx` with the following content:
+
[source, bash]
----
worker_processes  1;
user       nginx;
pid        /var/run/nginx.pid;

events {
  worker_connections  1024;
}

http {
    keepalive_timeout  65;

    server {
        listen 8080;

        location /.well-known/jwks {
            default_type  application/json;
            root /var/www/nginx;
            try_files /jwks.json =404;
        }
    }
}
----
+
In addition, create a file named `jwks.json` with the public key required to verify the tokens we're going to use.
+
[source, json]
----
{
  "keys": [{
    "use":"sig",
    "kty":"EC",
    "kid":"key-1",
    "crv":"P-256",
    "alg":"ES256",
    "x":"cv6F6SgBSNWMZKdApZXSuPD6QPtvQyMpk-iRfZxT-vo",
    "y":"C1r3OClUvyDgmDQdvxMdB-ucmZ28b8s4uM4Yg-0BZZ4"
  }]
}
----
+
We will add it to the above referenced `/var/www/nginx` folder, when we define our setup environments.

. Time to configure the environment to play with. If you want to run **heimdall as proxy**, create or copy the following `docker-compose.yaml` file and modify it to include the correct paths to your `heimdall-config.yaml`, `upstream-rules.yaml`, `policy.rego`, `idp.nginx` and the `jwks.json` files from above:
+
[source, yaml]

<1> These lines configure heimdall to use our config, our key store, and the rule file and to run in proxy operation mode.

. Alternatively, if you would like to implement **EAA with heimdall**, create or copy the following `docker-compose-eaa.yaml` file and modify it to include the correct paths to the `heimdall-config.yaml`, `upstream-rules.yaml`, `policy.rego`, `idp.nginx` and the `jwks.json` files from above as well:

<1> These lines configure Traefik, which is used to dispatch the incoming requests and also forward all of them to heimdall before routing to the target service. We're using the ForwardAuth middleware here, which requires an additional configuration on the route level.
<2> Here we configure Trafik to forward the requests to heimdall
<3> These lines configure heimdall to use our config, our key store, and the rule file and to run in decision operation mode.
<4> Here, we configure the "upstream" service. As already written above, it is a very simple service, which just echoes back everything it receives. As also written above, we need to provide some route level configuration here to have the requests forwarded to heimdall. We could however also have a global configuration (which we decided not to do to avoid yet another configuration file).
<5> This is our NGINX, which mimics an IDP system and exposes an JWKS endpoint with our key material.
<6> And these lines configure our OPA instance to use our authorization policy

== Start Environment

Open your terminal and start the services in the directory, the above `docker-compose.yaml` file is located in with

[source, bash]
----
$ docker-compose up
----

== Consume the API

Roll up your sleeves. We're going to play with our setup now. Open a new terminal window and put it nearby the terminal, you started the environment in. This way you'll see what is going on in the environment when you use it.

. Let's try the `/public` endpoint first
+
[source, bash]
----
$ curl 127.0.0.1:9090/public
----
+
You should see an output similar to the one shown below
+
[source, bash]
----
Hostname: 94e60bba8498
IP: 127.0.0.1
IP: 172.19.0.3
RemoteAddr: 172.19.0.4:53980
GET /public HTTP/1.1
Host: upstream:8081
User-Agent: curl/8.2.1
Accept: */*
Accept-Encoding: gzip
Forwarded: for=172.19.0.1;host=127.0.0.1:9090;proto=http
----
+
That was obviously expected as we've sent a request to our public endpoint.

. Let's try some other endpoints:
+
[source, bash]
----
$ curl -v 127.0.0.1:9090/admin
----
+
The `-v` flag has be added to the curl command by intention. Without it, we'll not see any output. With it, we'll see the response shown below
+
[source, bash]
----
* processing: 127.0.0.1:9090/admin
*   Trying 127.0.0.1:9090...
* Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 9090
> GET /admin HTTP/1.1
> Host: 127.0.0.1:9090
> User-Agent: curl/8.2.1
> Accept: */*

< Date: Wed, 06 Mar 2024 16:14:05 GMT
< Content-Length: 0
<
* Connection #0 to host 127.0.0.1 left intact
----
+
That is, unauthorized. Requests to any other endpoint, but `/public` will result in the same output.

. Let us now use a proper JWT, which will allow us to send requests to either the `/admin` or the `/user` endpoint. Below, you'll find a new request using curl to our `/admin` endpoint again. This time however, it contains an `Authorization` header with a bearer token in it which should allow us getting access. Try it out.
+
[source, bash]
----
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6ImtleS0xIiwidHlwIjoiSldUIn0.eyJleHAiOjIwMjUxMDA3NTEsImlhdCI6MTcwOTc0MDc1MSwiaXNzIjoiZGVtb19pc3N1ZXIiLCJqdGkiOiI0NjExZDM5Yy00MzI1LTRhMWYtYjdkOC1iMmYxMTE3NDEyYzAiLCJuYmYiOjE3MDk3NDA3NTEsInJvbGUiOiJhZG1pbiIsInN1YiI6IjEifQ.mZZ_UqC8RVzEKBPZbPs4eP-MkXLK22Q27ZJ34UwJiioFdaYXqYJ4ZsatP0TbpKeNyF83mkrrCGL_pWLFTho7Gg" 127.0.0.1:9090/admin
----
+
We can now access the endpoint and see the following output
+
[source, bash]

----

Take a closer look at the JWT echoed by our service, e.g. by making use of https://jwt.io. It has been issued by heimdall and is not the token you've sent using curl.

. Guess what would happen, when we try the same request, but to the `/user` endpoint? You're right, it will be refused due to the wrong role. Let us then use another JWT. Try the request shown below. It contains a token which should give us access.
+
[source, bash]
----
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6ImtleS0xIiwidHlwIjoiSldUIn0.eyJleHAiOjIwMjUxMDA3NTEsImlhdCI6MTcwOTc0MDc1MSwiaXNzIjoiZGVtb19pc3N1ZXIiLCJqdGkiOiIzZmFmNDkxOS0wZjUwLTQ3NGItOGExMy0yOTYzMjEzNThlOTMiLCJuYmYiOjE3MDk3NDA3NTEsInJvbGUiOiJ1c2VyIiwic3ViIjoiMiJ9.W5xCpwsFShS0RpOtrm9vrV2dN6K8pRr5gQnt0kluzLE6oNWFzf7Oot-0YLCPa64Z3XPd7cfGcBiSjrzKZSAj4g" 127.0.0.1:9090/user
----
+
Was successful, right? We omitted the output for brevity reasons. This guide is already long enough.

. Try to send requests to the `/private` endpoint using any of the tokens from above. Yep. Useless. Heimdall will not let us through.

== Cleanup

Just stop the environment with `CTRL-C` and delete the created files. If you started docker compose in the background, tear the environment down with

[source, bash]
----
$ docker-compose down
----
