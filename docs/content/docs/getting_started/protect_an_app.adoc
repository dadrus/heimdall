description: This simple quickstart guide will walk you through the steps to protect an application using heimdall. You'll learn how to configure heimdall as an authentication and authorization proxy in front of your application, as well as how to implement an Edge-level Authorization Architecture (EAA) with heimdall's help.
---

:toc:

== Overview

In this guide, we'll configure two setups to protect a service that exposes a few endpoints:

* The `/public` endpoint is, as the name implies, public. Every request to it should be forwarded as is.
* The `/user` endpoint should only be accessible to users with the `user` role.
* The `/admin` endpoint should only be accessible to users with the `admin` role.
* The `/private` endpoint, along with any other potentially exposed endpoints, should not be accessible at all. All requests to it should be rejected.

For authentication, we'll use JWTs containing the respective roles. Authorization will be handled with the help of Open Policy Agent (OPA).

In both setups, we'll create minimal but complete environments using Docker Compose with:

* https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/[Traefik] as the edge proxy,
* https://hub.docker.com/r/containous/whoami/[containous/whoami] (a service that echoes back everything it receives), mimicking our service exposing the endpoints described above,
* an https://nginx.org/en/[NGINX] server serving the public key for verifying the JWTs (mimicking the JWKS endpoint typically exposed by an OIDC provider),
* https://www.openpolicyagent.org/[OPA], which evaluates the authorization policy,
* heimdall, orchestrating everything to enforce the above requirements.

NOTE: This quickstart and others demonstrating different integration options are also available on https://github.com/dadrus/heimdall/tree/main/examples/docker-compose/quickstarts[GitHub].


== Prerequisites

To follow this guide, you'll need the following tools installed locally:

* https://docs.docker.com/install/[Docker],
* https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[docker-compose], and
* a text editor of your choice.

== Configure

. Heimdall can be configured via environment variables, as well as using a configuration file. For simplicity, we'll use a configuration file in this guide. Create a file named `heimdall-config.yaml` with the following contents:
+
[source, yaml]

    src: /etc/heimdall/rules.yaml
    watch: true
----
<1> Since heimdall emits logs at the `error` level by default, and we want to monitor what’s happening, we'll set the log level to `debug`. This way, we'll not only see the results of a particular rule execution (which you would see with the `info` log level), but also detailed logs of what's going on inside each rule. Additionally, we disable tracing and metrics collection, which are pulled by default to an OTEL agent, to avoid error messages related to the unavailability of the agent. For more information on available observability options, see the link:{{< relref "/docs/operations/observability.adoc#_logging" >}}[Observability] chapter.
<2> This configuration instructs heimdall to trust `X-Forwarded-*` headers from any source. We need this for integration with Traefik, which uses these headers while forwarding requests to heimdall. The IP address used depends on your local Docker configuration.
+
WARNING: Never use this in production - always restrict trusted IPs instead! Refer to the documentation on the link:{{< relref "/docs/services/main.adoc#_trusted_proxies" >}}[trusted_proxies] property and link:{{< relref "/docs/operations/security.adoc#_http_header_security_considerations" >}}[Security Considerations] for more details.
<3> Here, we define our link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/catalogue.adoc" >}}[catalogue of mechanisms] to be used in link:{{< relref "/docs/rules/regular_rule.adoc" >}}[upstream service-specific rules]. In this case, we define authenticators, an authorizer, and finalizers.
<4> These two lines define the `link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/authenticators.adoc#_unauthorized" >}}[unauthorized]` authenticator named `deny_all`, which rejects all requests.
<5> These two lines define the `link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/authenticators.adoc#_anonymous" >}}[anonymous]` authenticator named `anon`, which allows any request and creates a subject with the ID set to `anonymous`. You can find more information about the subject and other objects link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/evaluation_objects.adoc#_subject" >}}[here].
<6> This and the following lines define and configure the `link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/authenticators.adoc#_jwt" >}}[jwt]` authenticator named `jwt_auth`. With this configuration, it will check if a request contains an `Authorization` header with a bearer token in JWT format and validate it using key material fetched from the JWKS endpoint. It will reject requests without a valid JWT or create a subject with the `sub` claim set to the token's `sub` value. All other claims will also be added to the subject’s attributes.
<7> Here, we define and configure a `link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/authorizers.adoc#_remote" >}}[remote]` authorizer named `opa`. Note how we allow for the overriding of particular settings, which will be specified below when we define the rules.
<8> The following lines define the `link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/finalizers.adoc#_jwt" >}}[jwt]` finalizer. This configuration will generate a JWT from the subject object with standard claims, setting the `sub` claim to the subject's ID. The key material used for signing is pulled from the referenced key store.
<9> These two lines conclude the definition of our mechanisms catalogue and define the `link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/finalizers.adoc#_noop" >}}[noop]` finalizer, which, as the name implies, does nothing.
<10> With the mechanisms catalogue in place, we can now define a link:{{< relref "/docs/rules/default_rule.adoc" >}}[default rule]. This rule will be triggered if no other rule matches the request. It also acts as a link:{{< relref "/docs/concepts/rules.adoc#_default_rule_inheritance" >}}[base] for defining regular (upstream service-specific) rules. This rule defines a secure default link:{{< relref "/docs/concepts/pipelines.adoc#_authentication_authorization_pipeline" >}}[authentication & authorization pipeline], which denies any request using the `deny_all` authenticator. If overridden by a regular rule, it will create a JWT using the `jwt` finalizer.
<11> The last few lines configure the link:{{< relref "/docs/rules/providers.adoc#_filesystem" >}}[`file_system`] provider, which allows loading regular rules from the file system. The provider is also configured to watch for changes, so you can modify the rules in real time.

. Create a file named `signer.pem` with the following content. This file is our key store with a private key, which you’ll see referenced in the configuration above.

WARNING: Do not use this for purposes beyond this tutorial!

. Now, create a rule file named `upstream-rules.yaml` to implement the authentication and authorization requirements for your service. Copy the following contents into it:
+
[source, yaml]
----
version: "1alpha4"
rules:
- id: demo:public  # <1>
  match:
    routes:
      - path: /public
  forward_to:
    host: upstream:8081
  execute:
  - authenticator: anon
  - finalizer: noop

- id: demo:protected  # <2>
  match:
    routes:
      - path: /:user
        path_params:
          - name: user
            type: glob
            value: "{user,admin}"
  forward_to:
    host: upstream:8081
  execute:
  - authenticator: jwt_auth
  - authorizer: opa
    config:
      values:
        policy: demo/can_access
      payload: |
        {
          "input": {
            "role": {{ quote .Subject.Attributes.role }},
            "path": {{ quote .Request.URL.Path }}
          }
        }
----
+
<1> This rule matches the `/public` endpoint and forwards the request to our upstream service without performing any verification or transformation.
<2> This rule matches the `/user` and `/admin` endpoints, handling both authentication and authorization steps.
+
NOTE: Since we don't define a finalizer in the second rule's pipeline, the default rule's finalizer is reused. There is no need for additional rules, as the default rule will block requests to any other endpoints.

. Now that everything related to heimdall configuration is in place, let's create a policy that OPA will use. Create a file named `policy.rego` with the following contents:
+
[source, rego]
----
package demo

default can_access = false # <1>

can_access { split(input.path, "/")[1] == input.role } # <2>
----
+
Here, we define our policy `can_access` within the `demo` package. The policy is straightforward, evaluating to either true or false.
+
<1> By default, the `can_access` policy evaluates to false.
<2> It evaluates to true only when the last path fragment of the request matches the user's role.

. Now, let's configure NGINX to expose a static endpoint that serves a JWKS document under the `.well-known` path. This will allow heimdall to verify the JWTs we will use. Create a file named `idp.nginx` with the following content:
+
[source, bash]
----
worker_processes  1;
user       nginx;
pid        /var/run/nginx.pid;

events {
  worker_connections  1024;
}

http {
    keepalive_timeout  65;

    server {
        listen 8080;

        location /.well-known/jwks {
            default_type  application/json;
            root /var/www/nginx;
            try_files /jwks.json =404;
        }
    }
}
----
+
In addition, create a file named `jwks.json` containing the public key needed to verify the tokens we will use.
+
[source, json]
----
{
  "keys": [{
    "use":"sig",
    "kty":"EC",
    "kid":"key-1",
    "crv":"P-256",
    "alg":"ES256",
    "x":"cv6F6SgBSNWMZKdApZXSuPD6QPtvQyMpk-iRfZxT-vo",
    "y":"C1r3OClUvyDgmDQdvxMdB-ucmZ28b8s4uM4Yg-0BZZ4"
  }]
}
----
+
We will place it in the `/var/www/nginx` folder, as mentioned earlier, when we set up our environment.

. Now, let's configure the environment. To run **heimdall as a proxy**, create or modify a `docker-compose.yaml` file. Be sure to update it with the correct paths to your `heimdall-config.yaml`, `upstream-rules.yaml`, `policy.rego`, `idp.nginx`, and `jwks.json` files created earlier.

----
<1> These lines configure heimdall to use our configuration, key store, and rule file, and to run in proxy operation mode.

NOTE: We're using the `--insecure` flag here to simplify our setup, which disables enforcement of some security settings you can learn about more link:{{< relref "/docs/operations/security.adoc#_defaults" >}}[here].

. Alternatively, if you prefer to implement **EAA with heimdall**, create or modify the following `docker-compose-eaa.yaml` file. Be sure to update it with the correct paths to the `heimdall-config.yaml`, `upstream-rules.yaml`, `policy.rego`, `idp.nginx`, and `jwks.json` files from above.

----
+
<1> These lines configure Traefik, which is responsible for dispatching incoming requests and forwarding them to heimdall before routing to the target service. We use the ForwardAuth middleware here, which requires additional configuration at the route level.
<2> Here we configure Traefik to forward requests to heimdall.
<3> These lines configure heimdall to use our configuration, key store, and rule file, and to run in decision operation mode.
+
NOTE: We're using the `--insecure` flag here to simplify our setup, which disables enforcement of some security settings you can learn about more link:{{< relref "/docs/operations/security.adoc#_defaults" >}}[here].
<4> Here, we configure the "upstream" service. As previously mentioned, it is a very simple service that just echoes back everything it receives. We also need to provide some route-level configuration here to ensure requests are forwarded to heimdall. While we could have used a global configuration, we decided against it to avoid adding another configuration file.
<5> This is our NGINX service, which mimics an IDP system and exposes a JWKS endpoint with our key material.
<6> These lines configure our OPA instance to use the authorization policy.

== Start Environment

Open your terminal and start the services in the directory where the `docker-compose.yaml` file is located:

[source, bash]
----
$ docker compose up
----

== Consume the API

Roll up your sleeves. We're going to play with our setup now. Open a new terminal window and put it nearby the terminal, you started the environment in. This way you'll see what is going on in the environment when you use it.

. Let's try the `/public` endpoint first.

[source, bash]
----
$ curl 127.0.0.1:9090/public
----
+
You should see an output similar to the one shown below:
+
[source, bash]
----
Hostname: 94e60bba8498
IP: 127.0.0.1
IP: 172.19.0.3
RemoteAddr: 172.19.0.4:53980
GET /public HTTP/1.1
Host: upstream:8081
User-Agent: curl/8.2.1
Accept: */*
Accept-Encoding: gzip
Forwarded: for=172.19.0.1;host=127.0.0.1:9090;proto=http
----
+
That was expected, as we sent a request to our public endpoint.

. Now, let's try some other endpoints:

[source, bash]
----
$ curl -v 127.0.0.1:9090/admin
----
+
The `-v` flag is added to the curl command intentionally. Without it, we won't see the detailed output. With it, you'll see the response shown below:
+
[source, bash]
----
* processing: 127.0.0.1:9090/admin
*   Trying 127.0.0.1:9090...
* Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 9090
> GET /admin HTTP/1.1
> Host: 127.0.0.1:9090
> User-Agent: curl/8.2.1
> Accept: */*
>
< HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
< Date: Wed, 06 Mar 2024 16:14:05 GMT
< Content-Length: 0
<
* Connection #0 to host 127.0.0.1 left intact
----
+
That is, unauthorized. Requests to any endpoint other than `/public` will result in the same output.

. Let's now use a valid JWT to access either the `/admin` or `/user` endpoint. Here's a new request to our `/admin` endpoint, which includes a bearer token in the `Authorization` header. This should grant us access:

[source, bash]
----
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6ImtleS0xIiwidHlwIjoiSldUIn0.eyJleHAiOjIwMjUxMDA3NTEsImlhdCI6MTcwOTc0MDc1MSwiaXNzIjoiZGVtb19pc3N1ZXIiLCJqdGkiOiI0NjExZDM5Yy00MzI1LTRhMWYtYjdkOC1iMmYxMTE3NDEyYzAiLCJuYmYiOjE3MDk3NDA3NTEsInJvbGUiOiJhZG1pbiIsInN1YiI6IjEifQ.mZZ_UqC8RVzEKBPZbPs4eP-MkXLK22Q27ZJ34UwJiioFdaYXqYJ4ZsatP0TbpKeNyF83mkrrCGL_pWLFTho7Gg" 127.0.0.1:9090/admin
----
+
Now we can access the endpoint and see the following output:
+
[source, bash]
----
Hostname: 94e60bba8498
IP: 127.0.0.1
IP: 172.19.0.2

Forwarded: for=172.19.0.1;host=127.0.0.1:9090;proto=http
----
+
Take a closer look at the JWT echoed by our service, e.g. by making use of https://jwt.io[jwt.io]. This token has been issued by heimdall, not the one you sent with curl.

. Now, try the same request to the `/user` endpoint. It will be refused due to the wrong role. Let's use a different JWT that should grant us access.

[source, bash]
----
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6ImtleS0xIiwidHlwIjoiSldUIn0.eyJleHAiOjIwMjUxMDA3NTEsImlhdCI6MTcwOTc0MDc1MSwiaXNzIjoiZGVtb19pc3N1ZXIiLCJqdGkiOiIzZmFmNDkxOS0wZjUwLTQ3NGItOGExMy0yOTYzMjEzNThlOTMiLCJuYmYiOjE3MDk3NDA3NTEsInJvbGUiOiJ1c2VyIiwic3ViIjoiMiJ9.W5xCpwsFShS0RpOtrm9vrV2dN6K8pRr5gQnt0kluzLE6oNWFzf7Oot-0YLCPa64Z3XPd7cfGcBiSjrzKZSAj4g" 127.0.0.1:9090/user
----
+
This should work now. We omitted the output for brevity, but you should see a successful response.

. Try sending requests to the `/private` endpoint using any of the tokens from above. It will fail, as heimdall will not allow access.

== Cleanup

Once you're done, stop the environment with `CTRL-C` and delete the created files. If you started Docker Compose in the background, tear down the environment with:

[source, bash]
----
$ docker compose down
----
