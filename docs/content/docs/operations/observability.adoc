description: To support easier operation and integration in diverse APM products heimdall implements different observability mechanisms. The following sections provide insights about what can be expected.

:toc:

== Logging

Heimdall's implementation uses https://github.com/rs/zerolog[zerolog] - Zero Allocation JSON Logger, which can however also log in plain text. All emitted log statements include information related to distributed tracing (if tracing is enabled) so that not only log statements can be correlated to traces, but also all log statements belonging to single request/transaction can be correlated as well.

=== Configuration

Logging configuration can be adjusted in the `log` property of heimdall's configuration and supports following properties.

* *`format`*: _string_ (optional)
+
With `text` and `gelf` being the available formats. `text` is the default format. And `gelf` defines a JSON format adhering to https://docs.graylog.org/v1/docs/gelf[GELF].
+
WARNING: Usage of `text` (default) format is not recommended for production deployments as it requires more computational resources and is hence slow.
+
.Configuring logging to emit logs using GELD format.

[source, yaml]
----
log:
  format: gelf
----
====

* *`level`*: _string_ (optional)
+
Following log levels are available: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`, `panic` and `disabled`. The last one effectively disables logging. You usually do not want to do this. By default, the level is set to `error`.
+
WARNING: `debug` and `trace` log levels are not meant for production as setting log level to one of these will result in a high log verbosity and also affect performance pretty much. Both are only meant for setup analysis and debugging! `trace` log level will also dump all incoming and outgoing HTTP requests and responses, as well as the contents of objects used in templates. That dump is unedited. That means sensitive data will be available in logs.
+
NOTE: Due to some limitations of the GRPC framework capabilities, setting log level to `trace` will not dump GRPC requests and responses. If you need these for analysis purposes (e.g. when debugging the integration with envoy proxy), you'll have to set https://pkg.go.dev/net/http?utm_source=godoc#hdr-HTTP_2[`GODEBUG`] as well as the https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc/examples/features/debugging#section-readme[`GRPC_GO_LOG_VERBOSITY_LEVEL`] and https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc/examples/features/debugging#section-readme[`GRPC_GO_LOG_SEVERITY_LEVEL`] environment variables.

=== Regular Log Events

If you configure heimdall to log in `text` format, you can expect output similar to the one shown below:

[source, log]

WARNING: Usage of this format is not recommended for production deployments as it requires more computational resources and is hence slow.

Otherwise, if you configure it to use `gelf` (see https://docs.graylog.org/v1/docs/gelf[GELF] for format details) format, the output will look as follows:

----

Each log statement does also include the following fields in both log formats for incoming requests if tracing is enabled:

* `_trace_id` - The trace id as defined by OpenTelemetry.
* `_span_id` - The span id as defined by OpenTelemetry of the current transaction.
* `_parent_id` - The span id of the callee, which started the given transaction. Only present if the callee set the corresponding tracing header.

=== Access Log Events

In addition to regular logs, heimdall emits access logs. These events are always emitted regardless the configured log level and the log level of these events in the log output is always `INFO`.

Each request to any of heimdall's endpoints will result in two access events:

* event describing the start of the transaction, and an
* event describing the finalization of the transaction.

Following are the fields, which are always set for both events:

* `_tx_start` - Timestamp in Unix epoch format, when the transaction started.
* `_client_ip` - The IP of the client of the request.

If the event has been emitted for an HTTP request, following fields are set as well:

* `_http_method` - The HTTP method used by the client while calling heimdall's endpoint.
* `_http_path` - The used HTTP path.
* `_http_user_agent` - The agent used by the client. The value is taken from the HTTP "User-Agent" header.
* `_http_host` - The host part of the URI, the client is using while communicating with Heimdall.
* `_http_scheme` - The scheme part of the URI, the client is using while communicating with Heimdall.

If the event has been emitted for a GRPC request, following fields are set:

* `_grpc_method` - The full GRPC method used.

If the request comes from an intermediary, like e.g. an API Gateway and heimdall is configured to trust that "proxy" (see link:{{< relref "/docs/services/decision.adoc#_trusted_proxies" >}}[`trusted_proxies` configuration] of the Decision service, as well as the link:{{< relref "/docs/services/proxy.adoc#_trusted_proxies" >}}[`trusted_proxies` configuration] of the Proxy service), then following fields will be part of the events as well if the corresponding HTTP headers were sent.

* `_http_x_forwarded_proto` - The value of the "X-Forwarded-Proto" header.
* `_http_x_forwarded_host` - The value of the "X-Forwarded-Host" header.
* `_http_x_forwarded_uri` - The value of the "X-Forwarded-Uri" header.
* `_http_x_forwarded_for` - The value of the "X-Forwarded-For" header.
* `_http_forwarded` - The value of the "Forwarded" header.

Following are the fields, which are set in the transaction finalization event in addition:

* `_body_bytes_sent` - The length of the response body.
* `_tx_duration_ms` - The duration of the transaction in milliseconds. If heimdall is operated in proxy mode, it will also include the time used to communicate with the upstream service.
* `_access_granted` - Set either to `true` or `false`, indicating whether heimdall granted access or not.
* `_subject` - The subject identifier if the access was granted.
* `_error` - The information about an error, which e.g. led to the denial of the request.

If the finalization event has been emitted for an HTTP request, following fields are set as well:

* `_http_status_code` - The numeric HTTP response status code

If the finalization event has been emitted for a GRPC request, following fields are set:

* `_grpc_status_code` - The numeric GRPC status code.

Following are the fields, which are set if tracing is enabled:

* `_trace_id` - The trace id as defined by OpenTelemetry.
* `_span_id` - The span id as defined by OpenTelemetry of the current transaction.
* `_parent_id` - The span id of the callee, which started the given transaction. Only present if the callee set the corresponding tracing header.

If you configure heimdall to log in `text` format, you can expect output as shown below:

== Tracing

Heimdall makes use of https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry] for distributed tracing to support recording of paths taken by requests and supports all environment variables including the defined values according to https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/sdk-environment-variables/[OpenTelemetry Environment Variables] and https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/sdk-configuration/[OpenTelemetry SDK Configuration] specifications. In addition to these environment variables, heimdall defines some additional options, which are described below and can be used to tune the behaviour.

=== Configuration

By default, tracing is enabled and can be disabled or slightly tuned in the `tracing` property of heimdall's configuration supporting the following properties.

* *`enabled`*: _boolean_ (optional)
+
By making use of this property, you can configure heimdall to enable or disable tracing. Defaults to `true` (tracing enabled).
+
.Disabling tracing.
====
[source, yaml]
----
tracing:
  enabled: false
----
====

* *`span_processor`*: _string_ (optional)
+
With `simple` and `batch` being the available options. By setting this property, you can define how heimdall shall process the created spans. Defaults to `batch`. This property is only there, as there is no corresponding setting option via OTEL tracing environment variables available.
+
.Setting the span processor to export completed spans in batches.
====
[source, yaml]
----
tracing:
  span_processor: batch
----
====
+
Description of the options:
+
** `simple` - Configures heimdall to synchronously export the created spans via configured exporters. This is not recommended for production use as it is slow and has a high computation resource usage overhead. It might be however good for testing, debugging, or showing examples of other features.
** `batch` - Configures heimdall to send completed span batches to the exporter. Recommended setting for production use.

=== Tracing Context Propagation

When a request arrives at heimdall, it will create a trace context object based on the received headers, which according to OTEL are the `traceparent` and `tracestate` HTTP headers, defined in https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/[W3C Trace Context] as well as `baggage` HTTP header, defined in https://www.w3.org/TR/baggage/[W3C Baggage]. The creation of that context, as well as the transformation of it into new HTTP headers, set by heimdall while communicating with further services is named propagation and the components responsible for the creation of such context object are named propagators.

Since not every service in a multi-service system may set or understand the above OTEL specific HTTP headers (as these might still be using tracing vendor specific headers), interoperability can be achieved by configuring the required propagators by making use of the `OTEL_PROPAGATORS` environment variable. OTEL defines the following values for this variable:

* `tracecontext` - https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/[W3C Trace Context] propagator. Enabled by default, if `OTEL_PROPAGATORS` is not set.
* `baggage` - https://www.w3.org/TR/baggage/[W3C Baggage] propagator. Enabled by default if `OTEL_PROPAGATORS` is not set.
* `b3` - https://github.com/openzipkin/b3-propagation#single-header[Zipkin B3 Single Header] propagator.
* `b3multi` - https://github.com/openzipkin/b3-propagation#multiple-headers[Zipkin B3 Multiple Header] propagator.
* `jaeger` - https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.38/client-libraries/#propagation-format[Jaeger Header] propagator.
* `xray` - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-concepts.html#xray-concepts-tracingheader[AWS X-Ray Header] propagator.
* `ottrace` - https://github.com/opentracing?q=basic&type=&language=[OT Trace Header] propagator.
* `none` - No automatically configured propagator.

All of these are supported by heimdall. In addition, following propagators can be configured as well:

* `datadog` - https://www.datadoghq.com/product/apm/[Datadog APM Trace Header] propagator.footnote:[Datadog supports the OTLP protokoll. For that reason, there is no exporter available.]

Configured propagators are used for inbound, as well as for outbound traffic.

=== Span Exporters

Span Exporter handle the delivery of spans to external receivers (collectors, or agents). This is the final component in the trace export pipeline and typically provided by the APM vendor, like Jaeger, Zipkin, Instana, etc. Since not every multi-service system may have an up to day telemetry receiver supporting protocols defined by OTEL, interoperability can be achieved by configuring the required exporters by making use of the `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER` environment variable. OTEL defines the following values for this variablefootnote:[jaeger exporter has been marked as deprecated and is not supported anymore]:

* `otlp` - https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/protocol/otlp/[OTLP] exporter. Enabled by default if `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER` is not set.
* `zipkin` - https://zipkin.io/zipkin-api/[Zipkin] exporter to export spans in Zipkin data model.
* `none` - No automatically configured exporter for traces.

All of these are supported by heimdall. In addition, following exporters can be configured as well:

* `instana` - https://www.instana.com/[Instana] exporter to export spans in Instana data model.footnote:[Instana supports the W3C header used by OTEL. For that reason, there is no propagator available.]

=== Example Configuration

The environment variables set below configure heimdall to use Jaeger propagator and to export the spans via OTLP over grpc to the collector available under `\http://collector:4317`.

[source,text]
----
OTEL_PROPAGATORS=jaeger
OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=otlp
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_PROTOCOL=grpc
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT=http://collector:4317
----

If your environment supports OpenTelemetry and usage of defaults is ok, most probably, the only required environment variable to be set might be the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT`.

== Metrics

Heimdall makes use of https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry] to emit metrics. Depending on the configuration, push or pull based metrics export is supported.

=== Configuration

As with tracing, the entire configuration happens via environment variables as defined by https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/sdk-environment-variables/[OpenTelemetry Environment Variables] and https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/sdk-configuration/[OpenTelemetry SDK Configuration] specifications. The generated metrics can either be exported by pushing these to an OTEL collector (the default behavior). Alternatively, the available metrics can be pulled and are then exported in the (https://grafana.com/oss/prometheus/[Prometheus] style).

Metrics are generated and exported by default. If this is not desired, you can explicitly disable this behavior within the `metrics` property of heimdall's configuration by making use of the following property:

* *`enabled`*: _boolean_ (optional)
+
By making use of this property, you can configure heimdall to enable or disable the metrics collection. Defaults to `true` (metrics exposure is enabled).
+
.Disabling metrics.
====
[source, yaml]
----
metrics:
  enabled: false
----
====

==== Metric Exporters

By default, metrics are pushed to the OTEL collector using the `http/protobuf` transport protocol. You can change that behavior by making use of either the https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/sdk-configuration/otlp-exporter-configuration/#otel_exporter_otlp_metrics_protocol[`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_PROTOCOL`], or the https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/sdk-configuration/otlp-exporter-configuration/#otel_exporter_otlp_protocol[`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL`] environment variable.

To let heimdall know where to push the metrics to, either https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/sdk-configuration/otlp-exporter-configuration/#otel_exporter_otlp_metrics_endpoint[`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_ENDPOINT`], or https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/sdk-configuration/otlp-exporter-configuration/#otel_exporter_otlp_endpoint[`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`] must be defined.

To let heimdall expose metrics over a pull based service (https://grafana.com/oss/prometheus/[Prometheus] style), the https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/sdk-configuration/general-sdk-configuration/#otel_metrics_exporter[`OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER`] environment variable must be set to `"prometheus"`. In that case heimdall will expose the `127.0.0.1:9464/metrics` endpoint which can be queried using the HTTP GET verb. You can change the host and port of that service by making use of the https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/configuration/sdk-environment-variables/#prometheus-exporter[`OTEL_EXPORTER_PROMETHEUS_HOST`] and https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/configuration/sdk-environment-variables/#prometheus-exporter[`OTEL_EXPORTER_PROMETHEUS_PORT`] environment variables.

You can also disable metrics export by setting the `OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER` environment variable to `none`.

=== Available Metrics

* System metrics according to https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/metrics/semantic_conventions/system-metrics/[OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions for System Metrics].
* Process and Go runtime metrics according to https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/metrics/semantic_conventions/process-metrics/[OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions for OS Process Metrics].
* Information about the handled requests on each active service, as well as information about requests in progress according to OpenTelemetry https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/metrics/semantic_conventions/http-metrics/[Semantic Conventions for HTTP Metrics] and https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/metrics/semantic_conventions/rpc-metrics/[General RPC conventions].
* Information about the metrics endpoint itself (if enabled), including the number of internal errors encountered while gathering the metrics, number of current inflight and overall scrapes done.
* Information about expiry for configured certificates.

All, but custom metrics adhere to the https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/metrics/semantic_conventions/[OpenTelementry semantic conventions]. For that reason, only the custom metrics are listed in the table below.

==== Metric: `certificate.expiry`
Number of seconds until a certificate used by a particular service (decision, proxy, management), as well as signer expires. The metric type is UpDownCounter und the unit is s.

[cols="2,1,5"]

| `serial_nr`
| string
| The serial number of the certificate.

| `subject`

|===

== Runtime Profiling

If enabled, heimdall exposes a `/debug/pprof` HTTP endpoint on port `10251` (See also the configuration options below) on which runtime profiling data in the `profile.proto` format (also known as `pprof` format) can be consumed by APM tools, like https://github.com/google/pprof[Google's pprof], https://grafana.com/oss/phlare/[Grafana Phlare], https://pyroscope.io/[Pyroscope] and many more for visualization purposes. Following information is available:

* `allocs` - A sampling of all past memory allocations.
* `block` - Stack traces that led to blocking on synchronization primitives.
* `cmdline` - The command line invocation of the current program, with arguments separated by NUL bytes.
* `goroutine` - Stack traces of all current goroutines.
* `heap` - A sampling of memory allocations of live objects.
* `mutex` - Stack traces of holders of contended mutexes.
* `profile` - Cpu profile. Profiling lasts for duration specified in `seconds` parameter, or for 30 seconds if not specified
* `symbol` - Looks up the program counters listed in the request, responding with a table mapping program counters to function names.
* `threadcreate` - Stack traces that led to the creation of new OS threads.
* `trace` - Execution trace in binary form. Tracing lasts for duration specified in `seconds` parameter, or for 1 second if not specified.

See also the link:{{< relref "/openapi/_index.adoc#tag/Profiling" >}}[API] documentation for the documentation of the actual API.

=== Configuration

Configuration for this service can be adjusted in the `profiling` property of heimdall's configuration by making use of the following properties.

* *`enabled`*: _boolean_ (optional)
+
By making use of this property, you can configure heimdall to enable or disable runtime profiling. Defaults to `false` (profiling disabled).
+
.Enabling profiling.
====
[source, yaml]
----
profiling:
  enabled: true
----
====

* *`host`*: _string_ (optional)
+
By making use of this property, you can specify the TCP/IP address on which heimdall should listen for connections from client applications interested in profiling data. The entry `0.0.0.0` allows listening for all IPv4 addresses. Defaults to `127.0.0.1`, which allow only local TCP/IP “loopback” connections to be made.
+
NOTE: If you operate heimdall in a container, you should set this property to a value, which would allow your APM system to scrape this information.
+
.Configure heimdall to listen on `192.168.2.10`.
