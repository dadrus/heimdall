Authorizers ensure that the subject obtained via an authenticator step has the required permissions to submit the given HTTP request and thus to execute the corresponding logic in the upstream service. E.g. a specific endpoint of the upstream service might only be accessible to a "user" from the "admin" group, or to an HTTP request if a specific HTTP header is set.

The following section describes the available authorizer types in more detail.

== Authorizer Types

=== Allow

As the name implies, this authorizer allows any request passing through. This authorizer type also doesn't have any configuration options.

To enable the usage of this authorizer, you have to set the `type` property to `allow`.

.Configuration of Allow authorizer
====
[source, yaml]
----
id: allow_any_request
type: allow
----
====

=== Deny

As the name implies, this authorizer denies any request (on HTTP response code level this is then mapped to `Forbidden`). It basically stops the successful execution of the pipeline resulting in the execution of the error handlers. This authorizer type doesn't have any configuration options.

To enable the usage of this authorizer, you have to set the `type` property to `deny`.

.Configuration of Deny authorizer
====
[source, yaml]
----
id: deny_any_request
type: deny
----
====

=== Local (ECMAScript)

This authorizer allows definition of authorization requirements based on information available about the authenticated subject, as well as the actual request by using https://262.ecma-international.org/5.1/[ECMAScript 5.1(+)]. The script is expected to either return `false` or raise an error if authorization fails. In such cases this authorizer denies the request. So, the successful execution of the pipeline stops, resulting in the execution of the error handlers. Otherwise, the authorizer assumes, the script allowed the request.

If the script makes use of `raise` the corresponding message will be logged as reason for the failed authorization, otherwise a generic "authorization failed" will be logged.

To enable the usage of this authorizer, you have to set the `type` property to `local`.

Configuration using the `config` property is mandatory. Following properties are available:

* *`script`*: _string_ (mandatory, overridable)
+
ECMAScript which executes the actual authorization logic (see also link:{{< relref "overview.adoc#_scripting" >}}[Scripting]). Heimdall expects the script to return either `true`, if the authorization was successful, or otherwise `false`, or to raise an error. In latter case the message from the raised error will also be logged.

.Authorization based on subject properties
====

In this example the subject is checked to be member of the "admin" group.

[source, yaml]
----
id: user_is_admin
type: local
config:
  script: |
    if (heimdall.Subject.Attributes["group"] !== "admin") {
      raise("user not in admin group")
    }
----
====

.Authorization based on subject and request properties
====

In this example the authorizer is configured to ensure anonymous access to a resource is possible for read-only requests only.

[source, yaml]
----
id: no_modification_allowed_by_anonymous
type: local
config:
  script: |
    if (heimdall.RequestMethod() !== "GET" &&
        heimdall.Subject.ID === "anonymous")
      raise("anonymous access is not allowed")
    }
----

The usage of this type of configuration makes sense in a pipeline, which combines multiple link:{{< relref "authenticators.adoc" >}}[Authenticators], allowing anonymous and authenticated access.

====

=== Local (CEL)

This authorizer allows definition of authorization requirements based on information available about the authenticated subject, as well as the actual request by using https://github.com/google/cel-spec[CEL] based authorization expressions. Each expression is expected to return `false` if authorization fails. In such cases this authorizer denies the request. So, the successful execution of the pipeline stops, resulting in the execution of the error handlers. Otherwise, the authorization was successful.

To enable the usage of this authorizer, you have to set the `type` property to `cel`.

Configuration using the `config` property is mandatory. Following properties are available:

* *`expressions`*: _link:{{< relref "/docs/configuration/reference/configuration_types.adoc#_authorization_expression">}}[Authorization Expression] array_ (mandatory, overridable)
+
List of authorization expressions which define the actual authorization logic. Each expression has access to the following link:{{< relref "overview.adoc#_evaluation_objects" >}}[Evaluation Objects]:

** `Subject` of type link:{{< relref "overview.adoc#_subject" >}}[Subject].
** `Request` of type link:{{< relref "overview.adoc#_request" >}}[Request]

.Authorization based on subject properties
====

In this example the subject is checked to be member of the "admin" group.

[source, yaml]
----
id: user_is_admin
type: cel
config:
  expressions:
    - expression: |
        has(Subject.Attributes.groups) &&
        Subject.Attributes.groups.exists(g, g == "admin")
      message: User is not admin
----

The first line of the expressions verifies that the property group exists. The second line checks, whether `groups` contains an entry named `admin`.

This example specifies also a message, which is logged, if the expression fails.

====

.Authorization based on subject and request properties
====

In this example the authorizer is configured to ensure anonymous access to a resource is possible for read requests only.

[source, yaml]
----
id: no_modification_allowed_by_anonymous
type: cel
config:
  expressions:
    - expression: |
        Request.Method in ["GET", "HEAD", "OPTIONS"] || Subject.ID != "anonymous"
      message: Anonymous non-read access is forbidden
----

The usage of this type of configuration makes sense in a pipeline, which combines multiple link:{{< relref "authenticators.adoc" >}}[Authenticators], allowing anonymous and authenticated access.

====

=== Remote

This authorizer allows communication with other systems, like https://www.openpolicyagent.org/[Open Policy Agent], https://www.ory.sh/docs/keto/[Ory Keto], etc. for the actual authorization purpose. If the used endpoint answers with a not 2xx HTTP response code, this authorizer assumes, the authorization has failed and denies the request. So, the successful execution of the pipeline stops, resulting in the execution of the error handlers. Otherwise, if no script for the verification of the response if defined, the authorizer assumes, the request has been authorized. If a script is defined and does not fail, the authorization succeeds.

If your authorization system provides a payload in the response, Heimdall inspects the `Content-Type` header to prepare the payload for further usage, e.g. in the payload verification script, or in a link:{{< relref "#_local" >}}[Local] authorizer. It can however deal only with a content type, which either ends with `json` or which is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. In these two cases, the payload is decoded and made available for the script as well as a map in the `.Subject.Attributes`. Otherwise, the payload is treated as string and made also available for the script and in the `.Subject.Attributes` property. To avoid overwriting of existing attributes, this object is however not available on the top level, but under a key named by the `id` of the authorizer (See also the example below).

To enable the usage of this authorizer, you have to set the `type` property to `remote`.

Configuration using the `config` property is mandatory. Following properties are available:

* *`endpoint`*: _link:{{< relref "/docs/configuration/reference/configuration_types.adoc#_endpoint">}}[Endpoint]_ (mandatory, not overridable)
+
The API endpoint of your authorization system. At least the `url` must be configured. This handler allows templating of the url and makes the `Subject` object available to it. By default, this authorizer will use HTTP `POST` to send the rendered payload to this endpoint. You can override this behavior by configuring `method` as well. Depending on the API requirements of your authorization system, you might need to configure further properties, like headers, etc.

* *`payload`*: _string_ (optional, overridable)
+
Your template with definitions required to communicate to the authorization endpoint. See also link:{{< relref "overview.adoc#_templating" >}}[Templating].

* *`script`*:  _string_ (optional, overridable)
+
ECMAScript which executed further authorization logic on the given response from the authorization endpoint (See also link:{{< relref "overview.adoc#_scripting" >}}[Scripting]). Heimdall expects the script to return either `true`, if the authorization was successful, or otherwise `false`, or to raise an error. In latter case the message from the raised error will also be logged. Compared to the link:{{< relref "#_local" >}}[Local] authorizer, only `heimdall.Payload` object is available, which contains the response from the authorization endpoint, as well as the `console.log` function, which enables logging from the script. Latter can become handy during development of debugging. The output is only available if debug log level is set.

* *`forward_response_headers_to_upstream`*: _string array_ (optional, overridable)
+
Enables forwarding of any headers from the authorization endpoint response to the upstream service.

* *`cache_ttl`*: _link:{{< relref "/docs/configuration/reference/configuration_types.adoc#_duration" >}}[Duration]_ (optional, overridable)
+
Allows caching of the authorization endpoint responses. Defaults to 0s, which means no caching. The cache key is calculated from the entire configuration of the authorizer instance and the available information about the current subject.

.Configuration of Remote authorizer to communicate with https://www.openpolicyagent.org/[Open Policy Agent] (OPA)
====
Here the remote authorizer is configured to communicate with OPA. Since OPA expects the query to be formatted as JSON, the corresponding `Content-Type` header is set. Since the responses are JSON objects as well, the `Accept` header is also provided. In addition, this examples uses the `basic_auth` auth type to authenticate against the endpoint.

[source, yaml]
----
id: user_can_write
type: remote
config:
  endpoint:
    url: https://opa.local/v1/data/myapi/policy/allow
    headers:
      Content-Type: json
      Accept: json
    auth:
      type: basic_auth
      config:
        user: MyOpaUser
        password: SuperSecretPassword
  payload: |
    { "input": { "user": {{ quote .Subject.ID }}, "access": "write" } }
  script: |
    heimdall.Payload.result === true
----

In this case, since an OPA response could look like `{ "result": true }` or `{ "result": false }`, heimdall makes the response also available under `.Subject.Attributes["user_can_write"]` as a map, with `"user_can_write"` being the id of the authorizer in this example.
