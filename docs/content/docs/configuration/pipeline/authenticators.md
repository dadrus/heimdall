Authenticators inspect HTTP requests, like the presence of a specific cookie, which represents the authentication session of the subject with the service and execute logic required to obtain information about that subject. A subject, could be a user who tries to use particular functionality of the upstream service, a machine (if you have machine-2-machine interaction), or something different. Authenticators ensure the subject has already been authenticated and the information available about it is valid.
