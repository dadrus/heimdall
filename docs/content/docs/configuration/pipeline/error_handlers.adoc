Error Handlers are responsible for execution of logic if any of the handlers link:{{< relref "authenticators.adoc" >}}[authenticators], link:{{< relref "authorizers.adoc" >}}[authorizers], link:{{< relref "hydrators.adoc" >}}[hydrators] or link:{{< relref "mutators.adoc" >}}[mutators] fail. The error handlers range from a simple error response to the client which sent the request to sophisticated handlers supporting complex logic and redirects.

The following section describes the available error handler types in more detail.

== Error Handler Types

=== Default

This error handler is always there and is executed if no other error handler is responsible for the handling of an error. Actually, there is no need to explicitly configure it. The only exception is to allow overriding the link:{{< relref "../rules/_index.adoc#default-rule" >}}[default rule]'s error handler chain in a rule for performance reasons (if configured error handlers in the default rule should not be considered). This error handler type doesn't have any configuration options.

To enable the usage of this error handler, you have to set the `type` property to `default`.

.Configuring Default error handler to enable referencing it from rules
====
[source, yaml]
----
id: foo
type: default

=== Redirect

This error handler allows to redirect the client to another endpoint, e.g. to let the user authenticate. Technically this error handler returns e.g. a HTTP `302 Found` response code and sets the HTTP `Location` header.

To enable the usage of this hydrator, you have to set the `type` property to `redirect`.

Configuration using the `config` property is mandatory. Following properties are available:

* *`to`*: _URL_ (mandatory, not overridable)
+
The url to redirect the client to. If no `return_to_query_parameter` is defined, the value of the HTTP `Location` hader is set to the configured value.

* *`return_to_query_parameter`*: _string_ (optional, not overridable)
+
If you want to return the user back to the url, Heimdall was handling when this error handler kicked in and your authentication system supports this by considering a specific query parameter, you can configure it here.

* *`code`*: _int_ (optional, not overridable)
+
The code to be used for the redirect. Defaults to `302 Found`. Heimdall does not check the configured code for HTTP redirect validity!

* *`when`*: _link:{{< relref "configuration_types.adoc#error-condition" >}}[Error Condition] array_ (mandatory, overridable)
+
Conditions, which must hold true for this error handler to execute. The defined conditions are evaluated using a boolean or. So at least one of the defined conditions must evaluate to `true` to have this error handler executed.

.Redirect error handler configuration
====

The redirect error handler below is configured to kick in if either 
* a first error condition evaluates to true. This condition is for web requests (HTTP `Accept` header contains `text/html`) if an `authentication_error` error occurred (an error raised by authenticators). In this case, it will redirect the client (for web requests, usually a browser) to `\http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/login/browser` and also add the `return_to` query parameter with the current url to the redirect url.
* Or if a second condition evaluates to true. The only difference to the previous one is the error type, which is `authorization_error` in this case.

So, e.g. if Heimdall was handling the request for \`http://my-service.local/foo` and run into an error like described above, the value of the HTTP `Location` header will be set to `\http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/login/browser?return_to=http%3A%2F%2Fmy-service.local%2Ffoo`

[source, yaml]
----
id: authenticate_with_kratos
type: redirect
config:
  to: http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/login/browser
  return_to_query_parameter: return_to
  when:
    - error:
        - authentication_error
      request_headers:
        Accept:
          - text/html
    - error:
        - authorization_error
      request_headers:
        Accept:
          - text/html
----

In this case the error condition can actually be simplified, so the error handler configuration can look like this:

[source, yaml]
----
id: authenticate_with_kratos
type: redirect
config:
  to: http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/login/browser
  return_to_query_parameter: return_to
  when:
    - error:
        - authentication_error
        - authorization_error
      request_headers:
        Accept:
          - text/html
----

=== WWW-Authenticate

This error handler responds with HTTP `401 Unauthorized` and a `WWW-Authenticate` HTTP header set. As of now, this error handler is the only one error handler, which transforms Heimdall into an authentication system, a very simple one though ;). By configuring this error handler you can implement the https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7617[Basic HTTP Authentication Scheme] by also making use of the link:{{< relref "authenticators.adoc#basic-auth" >}}[Basic Auth] authenticator. Without that authenticator, the usage of this error handler does actually not make any sense.

To enable the usage of this hydrator, you have to set the `type` property to `www_authenticate`.

Configuration using the `config` property is mandatory. Following properties are available:

* *`realm`*: _string_ (optional, overridable)
+
The "realm" according to https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7235#section-2.2[RFC 7235, section 2.2]. Defaults to "Please authenticate".

* *`when`*: _link:{{< relref "configuration_types.adoc#error-condition" >}}[Error Condition] array_ (optional, overridable)
+
Conditions, which must hold true for this error handler to execute. The defined conditions are evaluated using a boolean or. So at least one of the defined conditions must evaluate to `true` to have this error handler executed.

.Configuration of WWW-Authenticate error handler
====

The www authenticate error handler below is configured to kick in for web requests (HTTP `Accept` header contains `text/html`) if an `authentication_error` error occurred (an error raised by authenticators). In this case, it will respond with HTTP `401 Unauthorized` and a `WWW-Authenticate` header set to `Basic realm="My fancy app"`.

[source, yaml]
----
id: basic_authenticate
type: www_authenticate
config:
  realm: "My fancy app"
  when:
    - error:
        - authentication_error
      request_headers:
        Accept:
          - text/html
