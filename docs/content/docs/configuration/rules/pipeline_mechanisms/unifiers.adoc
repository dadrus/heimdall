Unifiers finalize the successful execution of the pipeline and unify the available information about the link:{{< relref "overview.adoc#_subject" >}}[`Subject`] by transforming it into a format expected, respectively required by the upstream service. This ranges from adding a simple header to a structured JWT in a specific header.

== Unifier Types

The following sections describe the available unifier types in more detail. Some of these may support or require additional configuration. The corresponding properties are annotated with `mandatory`, respectively `optional` to denote configuration requirement, as well as with `overridable`, `not overriddable` and `partially overridable` to indicate whether the property can be overridden in a rule pipeline. Those unifiers, which support creation of custom objects via templating, have access to at least the link:{{< relref "overview.adoc#_subject" >}}[`Subject`] objects in the template. Some can also make use of the link:{{< relref "overview.adoc#_request" >}}[`Request`] object.

=== Noop

As the name implies, this unifier does nothing. As unifier are the last step in a rule pipeline and transform the available link:{{< relref "overview.adoc#_subject" >}}[`Subject`] information into a format required by the upstream service, the usage of this unifier makes only sense in combination with the link:{{< relref "authenticators.adoc#_noop">}}[Noop Authenticator], e.g. if your API should be publicly available. This authenticator type also doesn't have any configuration options.

To enable the usage of this unifier, you have to set the `type` property to `noop`.

.Noop unifier configuration
====
[source, yaml]
----
id: foo
type: noop

=== Header

This unifier enables transformation of a link:{{< relref "overview.adoc#_subject" >}}[`Subject`] into HTTP headers.

To enable the usage of this unifier, you have to set the `type` property to `header`.

Configuration using the `config` property is mandatory. Following properties are available:

* *`headers`*: _string map_ (mandatory, overridable)
+
Enables configuration of arbitrary headers with any values build from available subject information (See also link:{{< relref "overview.adoc#_templating" >}}[Templating]). Can also be used to build headers from the processed request object.

.Header unifier configuration
====
[source, yaml]
----
id: foo
type: header
config:
  headers:
    X-User-ID: '{{ quote .Subject.ID }}'
    X-User-Email: '{{ quote .Subject.Attributes["email"] }}'
----
====

=== Cookie

This unifier enables transformation of a link:{{< relref "overview.adoc#_subject" >}}[`Subject`] into cookies.

To enable the usage of this unifier, you have to set the `type` property to `cookie`.

Configuration using the `config` property is mandatory. Following properties are available:

* *`cookies`*: _string map_ (mandatory, overridable)
+
Enables configuration of arbitrary cookies with any values build from available subject information (See also link:{{< relref "overview.adoc#_templating" >}}[Templating]). Can also be used to build cookies from the processed request object.

.Cookie unifier configuration
====
[source, yaml]
----
id: foo
type: cookies
config:
  cookies:
    user_id_cookie: '{{ quote .Subject.ID }}'
    user_email_cookie: '{{ quote .Subject.Attributes["email"] }}'
----
====

=== JWT

This unifier enables transformation of a link:{{< relref "overview.adoc#_subject" >}}[`Subject`] object into a token in a https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519[JWT] format, which is made available to your upstream service in either the HTTP `Authorization` header with `Bearer` scheme set, or in a custom header. In addition to setting the JWT specific claims, it allows setting custom claims as well. Your upstream service can then verify the signature of the JWT by making use of heimdall's JWKS endpoint to retrieve the required public keys/certificates from.

To enable the usage of this unifier, you have to set the `type` property to `jwt`. The usage of this unifier type requires a configured link:{{< relref "/docs/configuration/cryptographic_material.adoc" >}}[Signer] as well. At least it is a must in production environments.

Configuration using the `config` property is optional. Following properties are available:

* *`claims`*: _string_ (optional, overridable)
+
Your template with custom claims, you would like to add to the JWT (See also link:{{< relref "overview.adoc#_templating" >}}[Templating]).

* *`ttl`*: _link:{{< relref "/docs/configuration/reference/types.adoc#_duration" >}}[Duration]_ (optional, overridable)
+
Defines how long the JWT should be valid. Defaults to 5 minutes. Heimdall sets the `iat` and the `nbf` claims to the current system time. The value of the `exp` claim is then influenced by the `ttl` property.

* *`header`*: _object_ (optional, not overridable)
+
Defines the `name` and `scheme` to be used for the header. Defaults to `Authorization` with scheme `Bearer`. If defined, the `name` property must be set. If `scheme` is not defined, no scheme will be prepended to the resulting JWT.

The generated JWT is always cached until 5 seconds before its expiration. The cache key is calculated from the entire configuration of the unifier instance and the available information about the current subject.

      "email_verified": {{ .Subject.Attributes.identity.email_verified }},
      "name": {{ if $user_name }}{{ quote $user_name }}{{ else }}{{ quote $email }}{{ end }}
