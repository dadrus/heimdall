Heimdall can expose runtime profiling data in the `profile.proto` format (also known as `pprof` format), which can be consumed by many APM tools, like https://github.com/google/pprof[Google's pprof], https://grafana.com/oss/phlare/[Grafana Phlare], https://pyroscope.io/[Pyroscope] and many more for analysis and visualization purposes. By default, this service is disabled. If enabled, the profiling information is available on `127.0.0.1:10251/debug/pprof` endpoint.

== Configuration

Configuration for this service can be adjusted in the `profiling` property of heimdall's configuration by making use of the following properties.

* *`enabled`*: _boolean_ (optional)
+
By making use of this property, you can configure heimdall to enable or disable runtime profiling. Defaults to `false` (profiling disabled).
+
.Enabling profiling.

[source, yaml]

profiling:
  enabled: true

* *`host`*: _string_ (optional)
+
By making use of this property, you can specify the TCP/IP address on which heimdall should listen for connections from client applications interested in profiling data. The entry `0.0.0.0` allows listening for all IPv4 addresses. Defaults to `127.0.0.1`, which allow only local TCP/IP “loopback” connections to be made.
+
NOTE: If you operate heimdall in a container, you should set this property to a value, which would allow your APM system to scrape this information.
+
.Configure heimdall to listen on `192.168.2.10`.

* *`port`*: _integer_ (optional)
+
By making use of this property, you can specify the TCP port the heimdall should listen on. Defaults to `10251`.
+
.Configure heimdall to listen on port `9999` for runtime profiling requests.
