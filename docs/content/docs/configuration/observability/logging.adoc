Heimdall logs concern everything that happens to Heimdall itself (startup, configuration, events, shutdown, and so on). Logs are written to stdout by default in text format.

== Configuration

Logging configuration can be adjusted in the `log` property of heimdall's configuration and supports following properties.

* *`format`*: _string_ (optional)
+
With `text` and `gelf` being the available formats. `text` is the default format. And `gelf` defines a JSON format adhering to https://docs.graylog.org/v1/docs/gelf[GELF].
+
WARNING: Usage of `text` (default) format is not recommended for production deployments as it requires more computational resources and is hence slow.
+

* *`level`*: _string_ (optional)
+
Following log levels are available: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`, `panic` and `disabled`. The last one effectively disables logging. You usually do not want to do this. By default, the level is set to `error`.
+
WARNING: `debug` and `trace` log levels are not meant for production as setting log level to one of these will result in a high log verbosity and also affect performance pretty much. Both are only meant for setup analysis and debugging! `trace` log level will also dump all incoming and outgoing HTTP requests and responses, as well as the contents of objects used in templates. That dump is unedited. That means sensitive data will be available in logs.
+
NOTE: Due to some limitations of the GRPC framework capabilities, setting log level to `trace` will not dump GRPC requests and responses. If you need these for analysis purposes (e.g. when debugging the integration with envoy proxy), you'll have to set https://pkg.go.dev/net/http?utm_source=godoc#hdr-HTTP_2[`GODEBUG`] as well as the https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc/examples/features/debugging#section-readme[`GRPC_GO_LOG_VERBOSITY_LEVEL`] and https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc/examples/features/debugging#section-readme[`GRPC_GO_LOG_SEVERITY_LEVEL`] environment variables.
