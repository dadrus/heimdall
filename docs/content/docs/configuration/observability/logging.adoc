Heimdall logs concern everything that happens to Heimdall itself (startup, configuration, events, shutdown, and so on). Logs are written to stdout by default in text format.

== Configuration

Logging configuration can be adjusted in the `log` property of heimdall's configuration and supports following properties.

* *`format`*: _string_ (optional)
+
With `text` and `gelf` being the available formats. `text` is the default format. And `gelf` defines a JSON format adhering to https://docs.graylog.org/v1/docs/gelf[GELF].
+

WARNING: Usage of `text` (default) format is not recommended for production deployments as it requires more computational resources and is hence slow.

* *`level`*: _string_ (optional)
+
Following log levels are available: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`, `panic` and `disabled`. The last one effectively disables logging. You usually do not want to do this. By default, the level is set to `error`.
