The Management service is always there, regardless of the mode of operation Heimdall is started in. By default, Heimdall listens on `0.0.0.0:4457` endpoint for incoming requests in this mode of operation and also configures useful default timeouts. No other options are configured. You can however adjust the configuration for your needs.

This service exposes the health and the JWKS endpoints.

== Configuration

The configuration for of the Management endpoint can be adjusted in the `management` property, which lives in the `serve` property of heimdall's configuration and supports the following properties.

* *`host`*: _string_ (optional)
+
By making use of this property, you can specify the TCP/IP address on which heimdall should listen for connections from client applications. The entry `0.0.0.0` allows listening for all IPv4 addresses. `0.0.0.0` is also the default setting.
+
.Configure heimdall to allow only local TCP/IP “loopback” connections to be made.

management:
  host: 127.0.0.1

* *`port`*: _integer_ (optional)
+
By making use of this property, you can specify the TCP port the heimdall should listen on. Defaults to `4457`.
+
.Configure heimdall to listen on port `4444` for incoming requests.

management:

* *`timeout`*: _link:{{< relref "/docs/configuration/reference/types.adoc#_timeout" >}}[Timeout]_ (optional)
+
Like written in the introduction of this section, Heimdall configures useful timeout defaults. You can however override this by making use of the `timeout` option and specifying the timeouts, you need.
+
.Setting the read timeout to 1 second, write timeout to 2 seconds and the idle timeout to 1 minute.
====

  timeout:
    read: 1s
    write: 2s
    idle: 1m

* *`buffer_limit`*: _link:{{< relref "/docs/configuration/reference/types.adoc#_buffer_limit" >}}[BufferLimit]_ (optional)
+
Read and write buffer limits (default to 4KB) for incoming requests and responses created by heimdall. You can however override this by making use of this property and specifying the limits you need.
+
.Setting the read buffer size limit to 1MB and the write buffer size limit to 2KB.
====

* *`cors`*: _link:{{< relref "/docs/configuration/reference/types.adoc#_cors" >}}[CORS]_ (optional)
+
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS[CORS] (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) headers can be added and configured by making use of this option. This functionality allows for advanced security features to quickly be set.

.Possible CORS configuration

management:
  cors:
    allowed_origins:
      - example.org
    allowed_methods:

    allow_credentials: true
    max_age: 10s

====

* *`tls`*: _link:{{< relref "/docs/configuration/reference/types.adoc#_tls" >}}[TLS]_ (optional)
+
By default, the Management endpoint accepts HTTP requests. Depending on your deployment scenario, you could require Heimdall to accept HTTPs requests only (which is highly recommended). You can do so by making use of this option.
+
