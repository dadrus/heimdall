description: Rule Sets organize rules, allowing versioning of such and loading by providers.
---

:toc:

Depending on the configured provider, the rules can be then loaded from e.g. a plain old configuration file, residing in the local file system, or even from a Kubernetes environment as a custom resource. Thus, the structure and format of a rule set depends on the link:{{< relref "/docs/rules/providers.adoc" >}}[provider] used to load it. As of today, there are two supported formats:

* as a regular JSON/YAML file, the so-called link:{{< relref "#_regular_rule_set" >}}[regular rule set], and
* as a kubernetes link:{{< relref "#_kubernetes_rule_set" >}}[custom resource rule set], which is actually a YAML/JSON file as well, but adheres to corresponding kubernetes requirements.

The main difference is the internal structure. Both do however require the specification of a version and a list or rules.

== Regular Rule Set

A regular rule set is a just a file with a list of rules and some additional meta information. Latter can be extended by a particular link:{{< relref "providers.adoc" >}}[provider] supporting that format.

Available properties are:

* *`version`*: _string_ (mandatory)
+
The version schema of the rule set. The current version of heimdall supports only the version `1alpha3`.

* *`name`*: _string_ (optional)
+
The name of a rule set. Used only for logging purposes.

* *`rules`*: _link:{{< relref "/docs/rules/regular_rule.adoc#_configuration" >}}[Rule Configuration] array_ (mandatory)
+
The list of the actual rule definitions.

.Rule set with two rules
====

An imaginary rule set file defining two rules could look like shown below.

[source, yaml]
----
version: "1alpha3"
name: my-rule-set
rules:
- id: rule:1
  match:
    url: https://my-service1.local/<**>
  methods: [ "GET" ]
  execute:
    - authorizer: foobar
- id: rule:2
  match:
    url: https://my-service2.local/<**>
  methods: [ "GET" ]
  execute:
    - authorizer: barfoo
----

== Kubernetes Rule Set

If you operate heimdall in kubernetes, most probably, you would like to make use of the `RuleSet` custom resource, which can be loaded by the link:{{< relref "/docs/rules/providers.adoc#_kubernetes" >}}[kubernetes provider].

=== Configuration

* *`apiVersion`*: _string_ (mandatory)
+
The api version of the custom resource definition, the given rule set is based on. The current version of heimdall supports only `heimdall.dadrus.github.com/v1alpha3` version.

* *`kind`*: _string_ (mandatory)
+
The custom resource kind. Must be set to `RuleSet`

* *`metadata`*: _map_ (optional)
+
The metadata, you would like to assign to the rule set, like the name of the rule set, labels, etc

* *`spec`*: _map_ (mandatory)
+
The actual specification of the rule set. Following attributes are possible, respectively required:

** *`authClassName`*: _string_ (optional)
+
References the heimdall instance, which should use this `RuleSet`.

** *`rules`*: _link:{{< relref "regular_rule.adoc#_configuration" >}}[Rule Configuration] array_ (mandatory)
+
The list of the actual rules.

[NOTE]
====
To be able to deploy and make heimdall use the `RuleSet` custom resources, the corresponding CRD must be deployed. Otherwise, heimdall will not be able to monitor corresponding resources and emit error messages to the log.

If you have used the link:{{< relref "/docs/getting_started/installation.adoc#_helm_chart" >}}[Helm Chart] to install heimdall, this CRD is already installed. You can however install it also like this:

[source, bash]
----
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dadrus/heimdall/main/charts/heimdall/crds/ruleset.yaml
----
====

.Simple Example
====
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: heimdall.dadrus.github.com/v1alpha3
kind: RuleSet
metadata:
  name: "<some name>"
spec:
  authClassName: "<optional auth_class reference (see above)> "
  rules:
    - id: "<identifier of a rule 1>"
      match:
        url: http://127.0.0.1:9090/foo/<**>
      execute:
        - authenticator: foo
        - authorizer: bar
----

=== Resource Status

In addition to configuration attributes described above, a `RuleSet` resource has a `status` stanza, which provides information about the usage status as soon as a `RuleSet` has been loaded by at least one heimdall instance.

By making use of `kubectl get -n <your namespace> rulesets.heimdall.dadrus.github.com` you'll get an overview of deployed `RuleSet` resources in a particular namespace, like e.g. shown below

[source, bash]
----
NAME             ACTIVE IN       AGE
test-rules       2/2             32m
----

The value `2/2` in `ACTIVE IN` means, <active in heimdall instances>/<matching instances>. With

* "matching instances" being those heimdall instances, which `auth_class` matches the `authClassName` in the `RuleSet` and
* "active in heimdall instances" are those from the "matching instances", which were able to load the `RuleSet`.

In addition, you can also get further information about the executed reconciliations by the deployed heimdall instances by taking a look at the `.status.conditions` field. The reconciliation status of matching instances is present there. That also means, if there were errors while loading the `RuleSet`, these are present in this condition list

E.g.

[source, bash]
----
$ kubectl describe -n test rulesets.heimdall.dadrus.github.com test-rules

Name:         test-rules
Namespace:    test
