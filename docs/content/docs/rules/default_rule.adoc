description: Heimdall lets you not only define upstream service specific rules, it does also support a definition of an optional default rule, which, if defined, kicks in, if no other rule matches. This way you can ensure secure defaults by simultaneously reducing the amount of work while defining upstream service API specific rules.

== Configuration

The configuration of the default rule can be done by making use of the `default_rule` property and configuring the options shown below.

[NOTE]
====
The default rule does not support all the properties, which can be configured in an link:{{< relref "regular_rule.adoc" >}}[regular rule].

* It can not be used to forward requests to an upstream service, heimdall is protecting. So, if you operate heimdall in the reverse proxy mode, the default rule should be configured to reject requests. Otherwise, heimdall will respond with an error.
* A default rule does also reject requests with encoded slashes in the path of the URL with `400 Bad Request`, which can be configured on the level of a regular rule.
====

* *`backtracking_enabled`*: _boolean_ (optional)
+
Enables or disables backtracking while matching the rules globally. Defaults to `false`.

* *`execute`*: _link:{{< relref "regular_rule.adoc#_authentication_authorization_pipeline" >}}[Authentication & Authorization Pipeline]_ (mandatory)
+
Which mechanisms to use for authentication, authorization and finalization stages of the pipeline. At least the authentication stage with at least one link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/authenticators.adoc" >}}[authenticator] must be defined. A specific rule (see also link:{{< relref "regular_rule.adoc" >}}[Regular Rule]) can omit the definition of that stage, if it wants to reuse it from in the default rule. Same is true for other stages (See also link:{{< relref "/docs/concepts/rules.adoc#_default_rule_inheritance" >}}[Rule Inheritance]).

* *`on_error`*: _link:{{< relref "regular_rule.adoc#_error_pipeline" >}}[Error Pipeline]_ (optional)
+
Which error handler mechanisms to use if any of the mechanisms, defined in the `execute` property fail. Allows omitting the definition of error handlers in specific rules. As soon as a specific rule defines at least one error handler mechanism, all error handler mechanisms, defined in the default rule are ignored. If not specified, the default error handler is used.

.Default rule configuration
====
[source, yaml]
----
default_rule:
  execute:
    - authenticator: session_cookie_from_kratos_authn
    - authenticator: oauth2_introspect_token_from_keycloak_authn
    - authorizer: deny_all_requests_authz
    - finalizer: create_jwt
  on_error:
    - error_handler: authenticate_with_kratos_eh
      if: |
        type(Error) == authentication_error && Error.Source == "session_cookie_from_kratos_authn"
----

This example defines a default rule, with the authentication 6 authorization pipeline consisting of two authenticators, with `session_cookie_from_kratos_authn` being the first and `oauth2_introspect_token_from_keycloak_authn` being the fallback one (if the first one fails), a `deny_all_requests_authz` authorizer and the `create_jwt` finalizer. The error pipeline is configured to execute only the `authenticate_with_kratos_eh` error handler.

Obviously, the authentication & authorization pipeline (defined in the `execute` property) of this default rule will always result in an error due to `deny_all_requests_authz`. This way it is thought to provide secure defaults and let the upstream specific (regular) rules override at least the part dealing with authorization. Such an upstream specific rule could then look like follows:

[source, yaml]
----
id: rule:my-service:protected-api
match:
  routes:
    - path: /foo
execute:
  - authorizer: allow_all_requests_authz
----

Take a look at how `on_error`, as well as the authenticators and finalizers from the `execute` definition of the default rule are reused. Easy, no?
