---

:toc:

In the simplest case, a regular rule reuses mechanisms from the previously defined link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/catalogue.adoc" >}}[catalogue] in its pipelines. In more complex scenarios, a rule can reconfigure parts of the mechanisms being used. The specific parts that can be reconfigured or overridden depend on the mechanism itself and are described in the mechanism-specific documentation. Reconfiguration is always limited to the particular rule's pipeline and does not affect other rules.

== Configuration

A single regular rule consists of the following properties:

* *`id`*: _string_ (mandatory)
+
The unique identifier of the rule. It must be unique across all rules loaded by the same link:{{< relref "providers.adoc" >}}[Rule Provider]. To ensure uniqueness, it's recommended to include the upstream service's name and the ruleâ€™s purpose in the id. For example, `rule:my-service:public-api`.

* *`match`*: _RuleMatcher_ (mandatory)
+
Defines the matching criteria for a rule, with the following properties:

** *`routes`*: _RouteMatcher array_ (mandatory)
+
Specifies route conditions for matching the rule to incoming HTTP requests with each entry having the following properties:

*** *`path`*: _string_ (mandatory)
+
The link:{{< relref "#_path_expression" >}}[Path Expression] describing the request path this rule should match. It supports both simple and free (named) wildcards.

*** *`path_params`*: _PathParameterConditions_ (optional)
+
Additional conditions which must be met for the values captured by named wildcards in the path expression. All defined conditions must succeed for the request path to be considered a match. Each entry supports the following properties:

**** *`name`*: _string_ (mandatory)
+
The name of the wildcard.

**** *`type`*: _string_ (mandatory)
+
The type of expression used to match the captured wildcard's value. The supported types are:

***** `glob`: to use a https://github.com/gobwas/glob[glob expression] to match the captured value (`/` is used as a delimiter, so `*` matches anything until the next `/`).
***** `regex` to use a regular expression to match the captured value.

**** *`value`*: _string_ (mandatory)
+
The actual expression based on the given `type`.

** *`backtracking_enabled`*: _boolean_ (optional)
+
Enables or disables backtracking when a request matches the path expressions but fails to meet additional matching criteria, like `path_params`, `hosts`, etc. This setting is inherited from the default rule and defaults to that rule's setting. When enabled, the system will backtrack to attempt a match with a less specific rule (see link:{{< relref "#_rule_matching_specificity_backtracking" >}}[Rule Matching Specificity & Backtracking] for more details).

** *`hosts`*: _HostMatcher array_ (optional)
+
Defines a set of hosts to match against the HTTP `Host` header. These conditions are "OR" conditions, meaning that at least one must match for a successful match. Each entry has the following properties:

*** *`type`*: _string_ (mandatory)
+
Specifies the type of expression for matching the host, which can be one of:

**** `exact` to match the host exactly
**** `glob` to use a https://github.com/gobwas/glob[glob expression] which should be satisfied by the host of the incoming request (`.` is used as a delimiter, which means `*` will match anything until the next `.`).
**** `regex` to use a regular expression which should be satisfied by the host of the incoming request.

*** *`value`*: _string_ (mandatory)
+
The actual host expression based on the `type`.

** *`scheme`*: _string_ (optional)
+
The expected HTTP scheme. If not specified, both http and https are accepted.

** *`methods`*: _string array_ (optional)
+
Specifies the allowed HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, etc). If not specified, all methods are allowed. To allow all methods except specific ones, use `ALL` and prefix the methods to exclude with `!`. For example:
+
[source, yaml]
----
# Methods list which effectively expands to all HTTP methods
methods:
  - ALL
----
+
[source, yaml]
----
# Methods list consisting of all HTTP methods without `TRACE` and `OPTIONS`
methods:
  - ALL
  - "!TRACE"
  - "!OPTIONS"
----

* *`allow_encoded_slashes`*: _string_ (optional)
+
Controls how to handle URL-encoded slashes in request paths during matching and forwarding. Options include:

** *`off`* - Reject requests with encoded slashes (`%2F`). This is the default behavior.
** *`on`* - Accept requests with encoded slashes decoding them to `/`.
** *`no_decode`* - Accept requests with encoded slashes without touching them.

+
CAUTION: Handling URL-encoded slashes may differ across the proxies in front of heimdall, heimdall, and the upstream service. Accepting requests with encoded slashes could, depending on your rules, lead to https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/436.html[Interpretation Conflict] vulnerabilities resulting in privilege escalations.

* *`forward_to`*: _RequestForwarder_ (mandatory in Proxy operation mode)
+
Defines the destination for proxied requests when heimdall operates in proxy mode. The following properties are supported:

** *`host`*: _string_ (mandatory)
+
Specifies the host (and port) to which the request should be forwarded. If no `rewrite` property (see below) is defined, the original URL's scheme, path, and other components remain unchanged. For example, if the original request is `https://mydomain.com/api/v1/something?foo=bar&bar=baz` and this property is set to `my-backend:8080`, the forwarded request will be sent to `https://my-backend:8080/api/v1/something?foo=bar&bar=baz`.

** *`forward_host_header`*: _boolean_ (optional)
+
Controls whether the `Host` header is forwarded to the upstream. Defaults to `true`.
+
**Note:** If a link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/finalizers.adoc#_header" >}}[header finalizer] sets the `Host` header in the `execute` pipeline, its value takes precedence over this setting.

** *`rewrite`*: _OriginalURLRewriter_ (optional)
+
Allows modifying additional parts of the original URL before forwarding the request. If set, at least one of the following supported (middleware) properties must be defined:

*** *`scheme`*: _string_ (optional)
+
Specifies the URL scheme to use when forwarding the request. Defaults to the scheme of the original request.
+
NOTE: Unless heimdall is started with the `--insecure-skip-upstream-tls-enforcement` flag, only `https` is allowed as the scheme.


*** *`strip_path_prefix`*: _string_ (optional)
+
This middleware strips the specified prefix from the original URL path before forwarding. E.g. if the path of the original url is `/api/v1/something` and the value of this property is set to `/api/v1`, the request to the upstream will have the url path set to `/something`.

*** *`add_path_prefix`*: _string_ (optional)
+
This middleware is applied after the execution of the `strip_path_prefix` middleware described above. If specified, heimdall will add the specified path prefix to the path used to forward the request to the upstream service. E.g. if the path of the original URL or the path resulting after the application of the `strip_path_prefix` middleware is `/something` and the value of this property is set to `/my-backend`, the request to the upstream will have the URL path set to `/my-backend/something`.

*** *`strip_query_parameters`*: _string array_ (optional)
+
Removes specified query parameters from the original URL before forwarding. E.g. if the query parameters part of the original URL is `foo=bar&bar=baz` and the value of this property is set to `["foo"]`, the query part of the request to the upstream will be set to `bar=baz`

* *`execute`*: _link:{{< relref "#_authentication_authorization_pipeline" >}}[Authentication & Authorization Pipeline]_ (mandatory)
+
Specifies the mechanisms used for authentication, authorization, contextualization, and finalization.

* *`on_error`*: _link:{{< relref "#_error_pipeline" >}}[Error Pipeline]_ (optional)
+
Specifies error handling mechanisms if the pipeline defined by the `execute` property fails. Defaults to the error pipeline defined in the link:{{< relref "default_rule.adoc" >}}[default rule] if not specified.

== Path Expression

Path expressions are used to match the incoming requests. When specifying these, you can make use of two types of wildcards:

* free wildcard, which can be defined using `*` and
* single wildcard, which can be defined using `:`

Both can be named and unnamed, with named wildcards allowing accessing of the matched segments in the pipeline of the rule using the defined name as a key on the link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/evaluation_objects.adoc#_url_captures" >}}[`Request.URL.Captures`] object. Unnamed free wildcard is defined as `\**` and unnamed single wildcard is defined as `:*`. A named wildcard uses some identifier instead of the `*`, so like `*name` for free wildcard and `:name` for single wildcard.

The value of the path segment, respectively path segments available via the wildcard name is decoded. E.g. if you define the to be matched path in a rule as `/file/:name`, and the actual path of the request is `/file/%5Bid%5D`, you'll get `[id]` when accessing the captured path segment via the `name` key. Not every path encoded value is decoded though. Decoding of encoded slashes happens only if `allow_encoded_slashes` was set to `on`.

There are some simple rules, which must be followed while using wildcards:

- One can use as many single wildcards, as needed in any segment
- A segment must start with `:` or `*` to define a wildcard
- No segments are allowed after a free (named) wildcard
- If a regular segment must start with `:` or `*`, but should not be considered as a wildcard, it must be escaped with `\`.

Here some path examples:

- `/apples/and/bananas` - Matches exactly the given path
- `/apples/and/:something` - Matches `/apples/and/bananas`, `/apples/and/oranges` and alike, but not `/apples/and/bananas/andmore` or `/apples/or/bananas`. Since a named single wildcard is used, the actual value of the path segment matched by `:something` can be accessed in the rule pipeline using `something` as a key.
- `/apples/:junction/:something` - Similar to above. But will also match `/apples/or/bananas` in addition to `/apples/and/bananas` and `/apples/and/oranges`.
- `/apples/and/some:thing` - Matches exactly `/apples/and/some:thing`
- `/apples/and/some*\*` -  Matches exactly `/apples/and/some**`
- `/apples/**` - Matches any path starting with `/apples/`, like `/apples/and/bananas` but not `/apples/`.
- `/apples/*remainingpath` - Same as above, but uses a named free wildcard
- `/apples/**/bananas` - Is invalid, as there is a path segment after a free wildcard
- `/apples/\*remainingpath` - Matches exactly `/apples/*remainingpath`

Here is an example demonstrating the usage of a single named wildcard:

[source, yaml]
----
id: rule:1
match:
  routes:
    - path: /files/:uuid/delete
  hosts:
    - type: exact
      value: hosty.mchostface
  execute:
    - authorizer: openfga_check
      config:
        payload: |
          {
            "user": "{{ .Subject.ID }}",
            "relation": "can_delete",
            "object": "file:{{ .Request.URL.Captures.uuid }}"
          }
----

== Rule Matching Specificity & Backtracking

The implementation ensures that rules with more specific path expressions are matched first, regardless of their placement within a rule set. In fact, more specific rules are prioritized even when they are defined across different rule sets.

When a path expression matches a request, any additional conditions specified in the rule's matching criteria are evaluated. Only if these conditions are met will the rule's pipeline be executed.

CAUTION: If multiple rules share the same path expression and all their additional conditions match, the first matching rule will be applied. The matching order is determined by the sequence of rules in the rule set.

If no rule is matched, and backtracking is enabled, the process will backtrack to attempt a match with the next less specific rule. Backtracking will stop when:

* a less specific rule successfully matches (including evaluation of any additional conditions), or
* a less specific rule fails to match and does not permit backtracking.

The following examples illustrate these principles:

Imagine the following set of rules

[source, yaml]
----
id: rule1
match:
  routes:
    - path: /files/**
execute:
  - <pipeline definition>
----

[source, yaml]
----
id: rule2
match:
  routes:
    - path: /files/:team/:name
      path_params:
        - name: team
          type: regex
          value: "(team1|team2)"
  backtracking_enabled: true
execute:
  - <pipeline definition>
----

[source, yaml]
----
id: rule3
match:
  routes:
    - path: /files/team3/:name
execute:
  - <pipeline definition>
----

The request to `/files/team1/document.pdf` will be matched by `rule2`, as it is more specific than `rule1`. Consequently, the pipeline for `rule2` will be executed.

The request to `/files/team3/document.pdf` will be matched by `rule3`, which is more specific than both `rule1` and `rule2`. As a result, the corresponding pipeline will be executed.

However, even though the request to `/files/team4/document.pdf` matches the path defined in `rule2`, the regular expression `(team1|team2)` used in the `path_params` for the `team` parameter will not match. Since `backtracking_enabled` is set to `true`, backtracking will occur, and the request will be matched by `rule1`, with its pipeline then being executed.

== Authentication & Authorization Pipeline

As described in the link:{{< relref "/docs/concepts/pipelines.adoc" >}}[Concepts] section, this pipeline consists of mechanisms, previously configured in the link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/catalogue.adoc" >}}[mechanisms catalogue], organized in stages as described below, with authentication stage (consisting of link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/authenticators.adoc" >}}[authenticators]) being mandatory.

* **Authentication Stage:** List of link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/authenticators.adoc" >}}[authenticator] references, each using authenticator as the key, followed by the required authenticator id. Regardless of their order in the pipeline, each authenticator serves as a fallback for the preceding one if it fails.
+
[NOTE]
====
Some authenticators rely on the same sources to obtain the subject authentication object. For example, both the `jwt` and `oauth2_introspection` authenticators retrieve tokens from the `Authorization` header by default. When using such authenticators within the same pipeline, it's best to configure the more specific ones before the more general ones to optimize performance. In this case, the `jwt` authenticator is more specific since it only processes tokens in JWT format. In contrast, the `oauth2_introspection` authenticator is more general - it doesnâ€™t depend on the token format and will attempt to handle any request containing a bearer token.
====

* **Authorization Stage:** List of link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/contextualizers.adoc" >}}[contextualizer] and link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/authorizers.adoc" >}}[authorizer] references in any order (optional). Can also be mixed. As with authenticators, the list definition happens using either `contextualizer` or `authorizer` as key, followed by the required `id`. All mechanisms in this list are executed in the order, they are defined. If any of these fails, the entire pipeline fails, which leads to the execution of the link:{{< relref "#_error_pipeline" >}}[error pipeline]. This list is optional.
* **Finalization Stage:** List of link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/finalizers.adoc" >}}[finalizer] references using `finalizers` as key, followed by the required finalizer `id`. All finalizers in this list are executed in the order they are defined. If any of these fail, the entire pipeline fails, which leads to the execution of the link:{{< relref "#_error_pipeline" >}}[error pipeline]. This list is optional. If a link:{{< relref "default_rule.adoc" >}}[default rule] is configured, and no `finalizers` are configured on a specific rule level, the `finalizers` from the default rule are used. If the default rule does not have any `finalizers` configured either, no finalization will take place.

In all cases, the used mechanism can be partially reconfigured if supported by the corresponding type. Configuration goes into the `config` properties. These reconfigurations are always local to the given rule. With other words, you can adjust your rule specific pipeline as you want without any side effects.

Execution of an `contextualizer`, `authorizer`, or `finalizer` mechanisms can optionally happen conditionally by making use of a https://github.com/google/cel-spec[CEL] expression in an `if` clause, which has access to the link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/evaluation_objects.adoc#_subject" >}}[`Subject`] and the link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/evaluation_objects.adoc#_request" >}}[`Request`] objects. If the `if` clause is not present, the corresponding mechanism is always executed.

.Complex pipeline
====

[source, yaml]
----
# list of authenticators
# defining the authentication stage
- authenticator: foo
- authenticator: bar
  config:
    subject: anon
  # ... any further required authenticator
# list of authorizers and contextualizers in any order
# defining the authentication stage
- contextualizer: baz
  config:
    cache_ttl: 0s
- authorizer: zab
- contextualizer: foo
  if: Subject.ID != "anonymous"
- contextualizer: bar
- authorizer: foo
  if: Request.Method == "POST"
  config:
    expressions:
      - expression: |
          // some expression logic deviating from the
          // definition in the pipeline configuration.
  # ... any further required authorizer or contextualizer
# list of finalizers
# defining the finalization stage
- finalizer: foo
- finalizer: bar
  config:
    headers:
    - X-User-ID: {{ quote .ID }}
  # ... any further required finalizers
----

This example uses

* two authenticators, with authenticator named `bar` being the fallback for the authenticator named `foo`. This fallback authenticator is obviously of type link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/authenticators.adoc#_anonymous" >}}[anonymous] as it reconfigures the referenced prototype to use `anon` for subject id.
* multiple contextualizers and authorizers, with first contextualizer having its cache disabled (`cache_ttl` set to 0s) and the last authorizer being of type link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/authorizers.adoc#_local_cel" >}}[cel] as it reconfigures the referenced prototype to use a different authorization expression.
* two finalizers, with the second one being obviously of type link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/finalizers.adoc#_header" >}}[header], as it defines a `X-User-ID` header set to the value of the subject id to be forwarded to the upstream service.
* contextualizer `foo` is only executed if the authenticated subject is not anonymous.
* authorizer `foo` is only executed if the request method is HTTP POST.
====

== Error Pipeline

Compared to the link:{{< relref "#_authentication_authorization_pipeline" >}}[Authentication & Authorization Pipeline], the error pipeline is pretty simple. It is also a list of mechanism references, but all referenced types are link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/error_handlers.adoc" >}}[error handler types]. Thus, each entry in this list must have `error_handler` as key, followed by the `Ã¬d` of the required error handler previously defined in the link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/catalogue.adoc" >}}[mechanism catalogue].

Execution of the error handlers should happen conditionally by making use of a https://github.com/google/cel-spec[CEL] expression in an `if` clause, which has access to the link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/evaluation_objects.adoc#_error" >}}[`Error`] and the link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/evaluation_objects.adoc#_request" >}}[`Request`] objects. Otherwise, the first error handler will be executed and the error pipeline will exit.

As with the authentication & authorization pipeline, partial reconfiguration of the used mechanisms is possible if supported by the corresponding type. The overrides are always local to the given rule as well.

.Two error handlers
====
[source, yaml]
----
- error_handler: foo
  if: # rule specific condition
- error_handler: bar
  config:
      # rule specific config
----
====

This example uses two error handlers, named `foo` and `bar`. `bar` will only be executed if `foo` 's error condition does not match. `bar` does also override the error handler configuration as required by the given rule.
