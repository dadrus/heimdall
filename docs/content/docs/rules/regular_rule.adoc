description: Regular rules allow definition and as such execution of arbitrary logic required by your upstream service. This page describes the available configuration options for a regular rule in detail.
---

:toc:

In simplest case a regular rule will just reuse mechanisms from a previously defined link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/catalogue.adoc" >}}[catalogue] in its pipelines. In more complex cases a rule can reconfigure parts of used mechanisms. Which parts can be reconfigured, respectively overridden are mechanism specific and described in the mechanism specific documentation. Reconfiguration is always limited to the particular rule pipeline and does not affect other rules.

== Configuration

A single regular rule consists of the following properties:

* *`id`*: _string_ (mandatory)
+
The unique identifier of a rule. It must be unique across all rules loaded by the same link:{{< relref "providers.adoc" >}}[Rule Provider]. To ensure this, it is recommended to let the `id` include the name of your upstream service, as well as its purpose. E.g. `rule:my-service:public-api`.

* *`match`*: _RuleMatcher_ (mandatory)
+
Defines how to match a rule and supports the following properties:

** *`url`*: _string_ (mandatory)
+
Glob or Regex pattern of the endpoints of your upstream service, which this rule should apply to. Query parameters are ignored.

** *`strategy`*: _string_ (optional)
+
Which strategy to use for matching of the value, provided in the `url` property. Can be one of:

*** `regex` - to match `url` expressions by making use of regular expressions. Internally, heimdall makes use of Heimdall uses https://github.com/dlclark/regexp2[dlclark/regexp2] to implement this strategy. Head over to linked resource to get more insights about possible options.
+
.Regular expressions patterns
====
* `\https://mydomain.com/` matches `\https://mydomain.com/` and doesn't match `\https://mydomain.com/foo` or `\https://mydomain.com`.
* `<https|http>://mydomain.com/<.*>` matches `\https://mydomain.com/` and `\http://mydomain.com/foo`. Doesn't match `\https://other-domain.com/` or `\https://mydomain.com`.
* `\http://mydomain.com/<[[:digit:]]+>` matches `\http://mydomain.com/123`, but doesn't match `\http://mydomain/abc`.
* `\http://mydomain.com/<(?!protected).*>` matches `\http://mydomain.com/resource`, but doesn't match `\http://mydomain.com/protected`.
====

*** `glob` - to match `url` expressions by making use of glob expressions. Internally, heimdall makes use of Heimdall uses https://github.com/gobwas/glob[gobwas/glob] to implement this strategy. Head over to linked resource to get more insights about possible options.
+
.Glob patterns
====
* `\https://mydomain.com/<m?n>` matches `\https://mydomain.com/man` and does not match `\http://mydomain.com/foo`.
* `\https://mydomain.com/<{foo*,bar*}>` matches `\https://mydomain.com/foo` or `\https://mydomain.com/bar` and doesn't match `\https://mydomain.com/any`.
====

* *`allow_encoded_slashes`*: _string_ (optional)
+
Defines how to handle url-encoded slashes in url paths while matching and forwarding the requests. Can be set to the one of the following values, defaulting to `off`:

** *`off`* - Reject requests containing encoded slashes. Means, if the request URL contains an url-encoded slash (`%2F`), the rule will not match it.
** *`on`* - Accept requests using encoded slashes, decoding them and making it transparent for the rules and the upstream url. That is, the `%2F` becomes a `/` and will be treated as such in all places.
** *`no_decode`* - Accept requests using encoded slashes, but not touching them and showing them to the rules and the upstream. That is, the `%2F` just remains as is.

+
CAUTION: Since the proxy integrating with heimdall, heimdall by itself, and the upstream service, all may treat the url-encoded slashes differently, accepting requests with url-encoded slashes can, depending on your rules, lead to https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/436.html[Interpretation Conflict] vulnerabilities resulting in privilege escalations.

* *`methods`*: _string array_ (optional)
+
Which HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, etc) are allowed for the matched URL. If not specified, every request to that URL will result in `405 Method Not Allowed` response from heimdall. If all methods should be allowed, one can use a special `ALL` placeholder. If all, except some specific methods should be allowed, one can specify `ALL` and remove specific methods by adding the `!` sign to the to be removed method. In that case you have to specify the value in braces. See also examples below.

* *`forward_to`*: _RequestForwarder_ (mandatory in Proxy operation mode)
+
Defines where to forward the proxied request to. Used only when heimdall is operated in the Proxy operation mode and supports the following properties:

** *`host`*: _string_ (mandatory)
+
Host (and port) to be used for request forwarding. If no `rewrite` property (see below) is specified, all other parts, like scheme, path, etc. of the original url are preserved. E.g. if the original request is `\https://mydomain.com/api/v1/something?foo=bar&bar=baz` and the value of this property is set to `my-backend:8080`, the url used to forward the request to the upstream will be `\https://my-backend:8080/api/v1/something?foo=bar&bar=baz`
+
NOTE: The `Host` header is not preserved while forwarding the request. If you need it to be set to the value from the original request, make use of the link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/finalizers.adoc#_header" >}}[header finalizer] in your `execute` pipeline and set it accordingly. The example below demonstrates that.

** *`rewrite`*: _OriginalURLRewriter_ (optional)
+
Can be used to rewrite further parts of the original url before forwarding the request. If specified at least one of the following supported (middleware) properties must be specified:

*** *`scheme`*: _string_ (optional)
+
If defined, heimdall will use the specified value for the url scheme part while forwarding the request to the upstream.

*** *`strip_path_prefix`*: _string_ (optional)
+
If defined, heimdall will strip the specified prefix from the original url path. E.g. if the path of the original url is `/api/v1/something` and the value of this property is set to `/api/v1`, the request to the upstream will have the url path set to `/something`.

*** *`add_path_prefix`*: _string_ (optional)
+
This middleware is applied after the execution of the `strip_path_prefix` middleware described above. If defined, heimdall will add the specified path prefix to the path used to forward the request to the upstream service. E.g. if the path of the original url or the pass resulting after the application of the `strip_path_prefix` middleware is `/something` and the value of this property is set to `/my-backend`, the request to the upstream will have the url path set to `/my-backend/something`.

*** *`strip_query_parameters`*: _string array_ (optional)
+
If defined, heimdall will remove the specified query parameters from the original url before forwarding the request to the upstream service. E.g. if the query parameters part of the original url is `foo=bar&bar=baz` and the value of this property is set to `["foo"]`, the query part of the request to the upstream will be set to `bar=baz`

* *`execute`*: _link:{{< relref "#_authentication_authorization_pipeline" >}}[Authentication & Authorization Pipeline]_ (mandatory)
+
Which mechanisms to use to authenticate, authorize, contextualize (enrich) and finalize the pipeline.

* *`on_error`*: _link:{{< relref "#_error_pipeline" >}}[Error Pipeline]_ (optional)
+
Which error handler mechanisms to use if any of the mechanisms, defined in the `execute` property, fails. This property is optional only, if a link:{{< relref "default_rule.adoc" >}}[default rule] has been configured and contains an `on_error` definition.

== Authentication & Authorization Pipeline

As described in the link:{{< relref "/docs/concepts/pipelines.adoc" >}}[Concepts] section, this pipeline consists of mechanisms, previously configured in the link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/catalogue.adoc" >}}[mechanisms catalogue], organized in stages as described below, with authentication stage (consisting of link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/authenticators.adoc" >}}[authenticators]) being mandatory.

* **Authentication Stage:** List of link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/authenticators.adoc" >}}[authenticator] references using `authenticator` as key, followed by the required authenticator `id`. Authenticators following the first defined in the list are used by heimdall as fallback. That is, if first authenticator fails due to missing authentication data, second is executed, etc. By default, fallback is not used if an authenticator fails due to validation errors of the given authentication data. E.g. if an authenticator fails to validate the signature of a JWT token, the next authenticator in the list will not be executed. Instead, the entire pipeline will fail and lead to the execution of the link:{{< relref "#_error_pipeline" >}}[error pipeline]. This list is mandatory if no link:{{< relref "default_rule.adoc" >}}[default rule] is configured.
+
NOTE: Some authenticators use the same sources to get subject authentication object from. E.g. the `jwt` and the `oauth2_introspection` authenticators can retrieve tokens from the same places in the request. If such authenticators are used in the same pipeline, you should configure the more specific ones before the more general ones to have working default fallbacks. To stay with the above example, the `jwt` authenticator is more specific compared to `oauth2_introspection`, as it will be only executed, if the token is in a JWT format. In contrast to this, the `oauth2_introspection` authenticator is more general and does not care about the token format, thus will feel responsible for the request as soon as it finds a bearer token. You can however also make use of the `allow_fallback_on_error` configuration property and set it to `true`. This will allow a fallback even if the verification of the credentials fail.
* **Authorization Stage:** List of link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/contextualizers.adoc" >}}[contextualizer] and link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/authorizers.adoc" >}}[authorizer] references in any order (optional). Can also be mixed. As with authenticators, the list definition happens using either `contextualizer` or `authorizer` as key, followed by the required `id`. All mechanisms in this list are executed in the order, they are defined. If any of these fails, the entire pipeline fails, which leads to the execution of the link:{{< relref "#_error_pipeline" >}}[error pipeline]. This list is optional.
* **Finalization Stage:** List of link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/finalizers.adoc" >}}[finalizer] references using `finalizers` as key, followed by the required finalizer `id`. All finalizers in this list are executed in the order they are defined. If any of these fail, the entire pipeline fails, which leads to the execution of the link:{{< relref "#_error_pipeline" >}}[error pipeline]. This list is optional. If a link:{{< relref "default_rule.adoc" >}}[default rule] is configured, and no `finalizers` are configured on a specific rule level, the `finalizers` from the default rule are used. If the default rule does not have any `finalizers` configured either, no finalization will take place.

In all cases, the used mechanism can be partially reconfigured if supported by the corresponding type. Configuration goes into the `config` properties. These reconfigurations are always local to the given rule. With other words, you can adjust your rule specific pipeline as you want without any side effects.

Execution of an `contextualizer`, `authorizer`, or `finalizer` mechanisms can optionally happen conditionally by making use of a https://github.com/google/cel-spec[CEL] expression in an `if` clause, which has access to the link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/evaluation_objects.adoc#_subject" >}}[`Subject`] and the link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/evaluation_objects.adoc#_request" >}}[`Request`] objects. If the `if` clause is not present, the corresponding mechanism is always executed.

.Complex pipeline
====

[source, yaml]
----
# list of authenticators
# defining the authentication stage
- authenticator: foo
- authenticator: bar
  config:
    subject: anon
  # ... any further required authenticator
# list of authorizers and contextualizers in any order
# defining the authentication stage
- contextualizer: baz
  config:
    cache_ttl: 0s
- authorizer: zab
- contextualizer: foo
  if: Subject.ID != "anonymous"
- contextualizer: bar
- authorizer: foo
  if: Request.Method == "POST"
  config:
    expressions:
      - expression: |
          // some expression logic deviating from the
          // definition in the pipeline configuration.
  # ... any further required authorizer or contextualizer
# list of finalizers
# defining the finalization stage
- finalizer: foo
- finalizer: bar
  config:
    headers:
    - X-User-ID: {{ quote .ID }}
  # ... any further required finalizers
----

This example uses

* two authenticators, with authenticator named `bar` being the fallback for the authenticator named `foo`. This fallback authenticator is obviously of type link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/authenticators.adoc#_anonymous" >}}[anonymous] as it reconfigures the referenced prototype to use `anon` for subject id.
* multiple contextualizers and authorizers, with first contextualizer having its cache disabled (`cache_ttl` set to 0s) and the last authorizer being of type link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/authorizers.adoc#_local_cel" >}}[cel] as it reconfigures the referenced prototype to use a different authorization expression.
* two finalizers, with the second one being obviously of type link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/finalizers.adoc#_header" >}}[header], as it defines a `X-User-ID` header set to the value of the subject id to be forwarded to the upstream service.
* contextualizer `foo` is only executed if the authenticated subject is not anonymous.
* authorizer `foo` is only executed if the request method is HTTP POST.

== Error Pipeline

Compared to the link:{{< relref "#_authentication_authorization_pipeline" >}}[Authentication & Authorization Pipeline], the error pipeline is pretty simple. It is also a list of mechanism references, but all referenced types are link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/error_handlers.adoc" >}}[error handler types]. Thus, each entry in this list must have `error_handler` as key, followed by the `ìd` of the required error handler, previously defined in the link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/catalogue.adoc" >}}[mechanism catalogue]. Error handlers are always executed as fallbacks. So, if the condition of the first error handler does not match, second is selected, if its condition matches, it is executed, otherwise the next one is selected, etc. If none of the conditions of the defined error handlers match, the link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/error_handlers.adoc#_default" >}}[default error handler] is executed.

As with the authentication & authorization pipeline, partial reconfiguration of the used mechanisms is possible if supported by the corresponding type. Same is true for overrides of the `if` conditions. The overrides are always local to the given rule as well.

.Two error handlers
====
[source, yaml]
----
- error_handler: foo
- error_handler: bar
  if: # rule specific condition
  config:
      # rule specific config
----
====

This example uses two error handlers, named `foo` and `bar`. `bar` will only be selected by heimdall if `foo` 's error condition (defined in the link:{{< relref "/docs/mechanisms/catalogue.adoc" >}}[mechanism catalogue]) does not match. `bar` does also override the error condition as required by the given rule.
