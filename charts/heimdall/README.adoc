= Heimdall Helm Chart

== Introduction

This chart helps you to deploy heimdall in your Kubernetes cluster using Helm.

**Note:** Heimdall follows the https://kubernetes.io/releases/version-skew-policy/#supported-versions[Kubernetes support policy], and supports at least the latest three minor versions of Kubernetes. General functionality cannot be guaranteed for versions older than that.

== Prerequisites

* A Kubernetes version >= 1.27
* https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/[Helm] 3.0+
* https://git-scm.com/downloads[Git] (optional)

== Getting the Chart Sources

This step is required if you want installing the chart using its sources. Additionally, the step may also be required for managing the custom resource definitions (CRDs), which heimdall requires, or for upgrading/deleting the CRDs.

To install the chart with the release name `my-release` (`my-release` is the name that you choose):

1. Clone the heimdall repo:
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/dadrus/heimdall
----

2. Change your working directory to the root directory of the cloned repository:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd heimdall
----

== Adding the Helm Repository

This step is required if you're installing the chart via the helm repository.

[source,bash]
----
$ helm repo add dadrus https://dadrus.github.io/heimdall/charts
$ helm repo update
----

== Installing the Chart

This chart supports setting of any environment variables for the deployment, e.g. to provide OTEL configuration. All environment variables must be configured under an `env` key. E.g. `helm install my-release --set env.MY_ENV=env-value dadrus/heimdall`

If you need to override the name of the heimdall resources such as the deployment or services, the traditional `nameOverride` and `fullnameOverride` properties are supported.

If you want to have detailed CPU & memory profiling information, you can enable the profiling service and let your APM scrape the corresponding pprof data. For https://grafana.com/docs/phlare[Phlare], the corresponding annotations are set if the profiling service is enabled.

=== Installing the CRD

By default, heimdall requires a custom resource definition (CRD) installed in the cluster. The Helm client will install it for you. If the CRD is not installed, you'll neither be able to deploy the corresponding rule sets, nor will heimdall be able to communicate with the api server.

=== Installing via Helm Repository

To install the chart with the release name "my-release" ("my-release" is the name that you choose) and configure heimdall to operate in decision mode:

[source,bash]
----
$ helm install my-release -f heimdall.yaml dadrus/heimdall
----

If you need proxy mode, install it with:

[source,bash]
----
$ helm install my-release -f heimdall.yaml --set operationMode=proxy dadrus/heimdall
----

In both cases you have to integrate it with your ingress controller. For decision mode that means setting corresponding annotations on Ingress resources to let the traffic first be verified by heimdall before it is forwarded to the upstream services by the Ingress Controller.

=== Installing Using Chart Sources

To install the chart with the release name "my-release" ("my-release" is the name that you choose) and configure heimdall to operate in decision mode:

[source,bash]
----
$ helm install my-release -f heimdall.yaml ./charts/heimdall
----

If you need proxy mode, install it with:

[source,bash]
----
$ helm install my-release -f heimdall.yaml --set operationMode=proxy ./charts/heimdall
----

=== Post-Install Steps

==== Integration with Ingress

After having installed heimdall, you have to integrate it with your ingress controller. For decision mode that means setting corresponding annotations on Ingress resources to let the traffic first be verified by heimdall before it is forwarded to the upstream services by the Ingress Controller.

==== Metrics Collection

===== Prometheus Style Metrics

If you have configured heimdall to expose a pull based (prometheus style) metrics endpoint, you can, assuming you are running a https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator[Prometheus Operator] in your cluster, create the following `PodMonitor` resource to enable metrics collection.

[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PodMonitor
metadata:
  name: heimdall-pod-monitor
  labels:
    release: prometheus
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: my-release
    app.kubernetes.io/name: heimdall
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: heimdall
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/instance: my-release
      app.kubernetes.io/name: heimdall
  podMetricsEndpoints:
    - path: /metrics
      port: http-metrics
      scheme: http
      interval: 30s
  jobLabel: heimdall-pod-monitor
  namespaceSelector:
    matchNames:
      - default
----

The definition of the `PodMonitor` above assumes, you've installed heimdall in the default namespace as shown in the above. If this is not the case, you need to adjust the `metadata` property by adding the corresponding `namespace` information, as well as the `namespaceSelector`.

If your Prometheus deployment is not done through the operator, you don't need to do anything, as the chart already sets the relevant annotations: `prometheus.io/scrape`, `prometheus.io/path` and `prometheus.io/port`.

== Upgrading the Chart

=== Upgrading the CRD

Helm does not upgrade the CRDs during a release upgrade. Before you upgrade a release, run the following command to upgrade the CRDs:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl apply -f ./charts/heimdall/crds/
----

=== Upgrading the Release

To upgrade the release "my-release" using Chart Sources:

[source,bash]
----
$ helm upgrade my-release ./charts/heimdall
----

To upgrade the release "my-release" using Helm Repository:

[source,bash]
----
$ helm upgrade my-release dadrus/heimdall
----

== Uninstalling the Chart
=== Uninstalling the Release

To uninstall/delete the release "my-release":

[source,bash]
----
$ helm uninstall my-release
----

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the release and deletes the release.

=== Uninstalling the CRDs

Uninstalling the release does not remove the CRDs. To remove the CRDs, run:

[source, bash]
----
$ kubectl delete rulesets.heimdall.dadrus.github.com
----

or if you have cloned the sources

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl delete -f ./charts/heimdall/crds/
----
