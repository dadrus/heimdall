{{- if eq .Values.operationMode "decision" }}
Heimdall is installed and configured to operate in decision mode.

To integrate heimdall with your Ingress Controller, you have to annotate the corresponding
Ingress resources to use it as authentication middleware and forward the requests to

"http://{{ include "heimdall.fullname" . }}.{{ .Release.Namespace }}.svc.cluster.local:{{ .Values.service.decision.port }}".

as well as forward the HTTP headers and/or cookies from heimdall responses to the upstream
services. Consult the Ingress Controller documentation of your choice on how to achieve this.

{{- else }}
Heimdall is installed and configured to operate in proxy mode.

  {{- if not .Values.demo.enabled }}

The actual integration depends pretty much on your requirements and setup.
  {{- end }}
{{- end }}

{{- if .Values.demo.enabled }}

The setup includes a demo app (which just echoes the request) and a rule set. If you're using NGINX as Ingress Controller, the abovesaid annotations are already added to the demo app ingress rule. So, to see heimdall in actions, just do.

> curl -v -H "Host: demo-app" <you cluster ip and port>/heimdall-demo/pub/test
This endpoint is not protected. so heimdall will just allow the request

> curl -v -H "Host: demo-app" <you cluster ip and port>/heimdall-demo/anon/test
This endpoint is configured to accept anonymous requests. So heimdall will allow the request,
but create a JWT with "sub" claim set to anonymous.

Requests to any other endpoints will be answered with HTTP 403. E.g.
curl -v -H "Host: demo-app" <you cluster ip and port>/heimdall-demo/foo
