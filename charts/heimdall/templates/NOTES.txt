{{- if eq .Values.operationMode "decision" }}
Heimdall is installed and configured to operate in decision mode.

To integrate heimdall with your Ingress Controller, you have to annotate the corresponding
Ingress resources to use it as authentication middleware and forward the requests to

"http://{{ include "heimdall.fullname" . }}.{{ .Release.Namespace }}.svc.cluster.local:{{ .Values.service.decision.port }}".

as well as forward the HTTP headers and/or cookies from heimdall responses to the upstream
services. Consult the Ingress Controller documentation of your choice on how to achieve this.

{{- else }}
Heimdall is installed and configured to operate in proxy mode.

The actual integration depends pretty much on your requirements and setup.
