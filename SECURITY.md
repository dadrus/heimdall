# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As long as the project is in its alpha phase, security updates are provided with a new release only.
That means patches for older releases will not be provided. This policy will be updated as soon as the project is considered to have evolved to beta.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities to dadrus@gmx.de. You will receive a response 48 hours.
If the issue is confirmed, a new release addressing the reported vulnerability will be done as soon as possible (depending on complexity).
