# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As long as the project is in its alpha or beta phase, security updates are provided with a new release only.
That means patches for older releases will not be provided. This policy will be updated as soon as the project is considered to have evolved to beta.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities by making use of [Security Advisories](https://github.com/dadrus/heimdall/security/advisories). Do not use GitHub issues for that. You will receive a response 48 hours. If the issue is confirmed, a new release addressing the reported vulnerability will be done as soon as possible (depending on complexity).
